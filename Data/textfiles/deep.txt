Deep learning is a powerful subset of machine learning that uses multi-layered artificial neural networks, inspired by the human brain, to automatically learn complex patterns from vast amounts of data, enabling AI to perform tasks like image/speech recognition and natural language processing with high accuracy, often without explicit programming. The "deep" part refers to the multiple hidden layers in these networks, allowing them to build intricate, hierarchical representations of data, from simple features to complex objects, as seen in self-driving cars or voice assistants. 
How it works
Inspired by the Brain: Uses nodes (neurons) in layers to process information, mimicking how our brains work.
Layered Learning: Data flows through an input layer, multiple "hidden" layers that extract features (e.g., edges, shapes, objects), and an output layer for the final result.
Feature Extraction: Early layers detect simple patterns; deeper layers combine these to recognize complex concepts (e.g., pixels -> shapes -> eyes -> cat).
Data-Driven: Learns by adjusting connections (weights) between neurons based on massive datasets, improving performance over time. 
Key Characteristics
Subset of AI/ML: A specialized approach within the broader fields of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning.
Less Preprocessing: Automates feature engineering, requiring less manual data preparation than traditional ML.
Scales with Data: Performance improves significantly with more data. 
Examples in action
Computer Vision: Recognizing faces, objects in photos, medical image analysis.
Natural Language Processing (NLP): Language translation, chatbots, sentiment analysis.
Speech Recognition: Virtual assistants like Siri or Alexa.
Autonomous Vehicles: Interpreting sensor data to navigate.
