'), Document(metadata={'source': '..\\\\Data\\\\textfiles\\\\neura.txt'}, page_content='Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) represent a cutting-edge technique in 3D computer graphics that uses neural networks to generate novel views of complex 3D scenes. Unlike traditional graphics pipelines that rely on explicit geometry and texture maps, NeRF models learn an implicit volumetric representation of a scene by optimizing a continuous function that maps spatial coordinates and viewing directions to color and volume density. This function is parameterized by a multilayer perceptron (MLP), allowing the scene to be rendered with photorealistic detail and consistent lighting effects.\\n\\nOne of the core innovations in NeRF is the use of volumetric rendering, where a ray is cast from the camera into the scene and sampled at multiple depths. At each sample point, the network predicts both the color and the density, and the final pixel color is computed as a weighted integration along the ray. This rendering technique enables the capture of complex visual phenomena like soft shadows, semi-transparency, and view-dependent reflections, which are difficult to model with traditional rasterization approaches.\\n\\nThe training of NeRF involves optimizing the MLP to minimize the difference between rendered views and a set of input images taken from known camera poses. This makes NeRF a data-driven method reliant on multi-view consistency. However, this also introduces a computational bottleneck: training can take hours and rendering each frame requires hundreds of MLP evaluations. To address this, subsequent research has focused on accelerating both training and inference using hierarchical sampling, voxel grids, hash encoding, and GPU parallelism.\\n\\nA particularly interesting crossover with machine learning comes from the application of positional encoding to enable MLPs to better represent high-frequency details. Positional encoding injects high-frequency functions of the input coordinates into the network, allowing it to overcome the spectral bias of standard MLPs that favor low-frequency outputs. This concept has strong ties to similar strategies used in transformer architectures for natural language processing, showcasing an elegant convergence of ideas across domains.\\n\\nAnother significant evolution has been the adaptation of NeRF-like models for dynamic scenes, where the geometry and appearance change over time. Techniques such as D-NeRF or Neural Scene Flow Fields extend the static NeRF framework to learn temporally coherent representations, capturing motion and deformation in the scene. These advances are crucial for applications like 4D reconstruction, virtual avatars, and telepresence, where both spatial and temporal fidelity are necessary.\\n\\nIn the context of 3D graphics pipelines, integrating NeRF with traditional graphics tools poses challenges, such as converting neural representations into mesh-based formats usable in real-time engines. Hybrid approaches attempt to bridge this by distilling neural fields into polygonal meshes or texture maps using differentiable surface extraction techniques. These methods allow neural representations to benefit from hardware-accelerated rasterization, pushing toward real-time performance.\\n\\nLastly, the interplay between inverse rendering and generative models has opened up new frontiers in content creation. By coupling NeRFs with generative adversarial networks (GANs) or diffusion models, researchers can synthesize plausible 3D content from minimal inputs like single images or text prompts. This fusion leverages the realism of learned priors and the physical consistency of volumetric rendering, paving the way for highly expressive and data-efficient tools in animation, gaming, and virtual reality.')]\n"

The final version will expand on notions included in \\nthis draft, and include more details with respect to the underlying mathematics of ML and a \\nbroader overview of insurance applications of ML. \\n \\nThe article begins with an overview of ML, including the types of ML and their components. \\nThen, for background, basic concepts associated with ML are addressed.

Similarly, the \\nlearning rate is a decreasing function of time. \\nEach iteration begins by randomizing the training sample, which is composed of P patterns, each \\nof which is represented by a numerical vector. For example, the patterns may be composed of \\nsolvent and insolvent insurance companies and the input variables may be financial ratios. Until \\nthe number of patterns used (p) exceeds the number available (p > P), the patterns are presented \\nto the units on the grid, each of which is assigned the Euclidean distance between its connecting \\nweight to the input unit and the value of the input.  \\nThe unit which is the best match to the pattern, the winning unit, is used to adjust the weights of \\nthe units in its neighborhood. The process continues until the number of iterations exceeds some \\npredetermined value (T). \\nIn the foregoing training process, the winning units in the Kohonen layer develop clusters of \\nneighbors which represent the class types found in the training patterns. As a result, patterns \\nassociated with each other in the input space will be mapped on to output units which also are \\nassociated with each other.

The \\nprocess starts with an initial population of solutions, P(0), which are randomly generated. From \\nthis initial population, the best solutions are “bred” with each other and the worse are discarded. \\nThe process ends when the termination criterion is satisfied. \\nThere are three ways to develop a new generation of solutions: reproduction, crossover and \\nmutation. Reproduction adds a copy of a fit individual to the next generation. Crossover emulates \\nthe process of creating children, and involves the creation of new individuals (children) from the \\ntwo fit parents by a recombination of their genes (parameters).  Under mutation, there is a small \\nprobability that some of the gene values in the population will be replaced with randomly \\ngenerated values. This has the potential effect of introducing good gene values that may not have \\noccurred in the initial population or which were eliminated during the iterations. The process is \\nrepeated until the new generation has the same number of individuals (M) as the current one. \\nA flowchart of the process for generating new populations of solutions is depicted in Figure 24. \\n \\n \\nFigure 24: Reproduction, crossover,  and mutation \\n \\n9.2.1 Insurance applications involving GAs \\nYan et al (2020) provides an example of a GA application in insurance.'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'Adobe PDF Library 11.0', 'creator': 'Acrobat PDFMaker 11 for Word', 'creationdate': '2020-11-09T20:45:24-05:00', 'author': 'Arnold F.

In recent years \\nmany successful machine learning applications have been developed, ranging from \\ndata-mining programs that learn to detect fraudulent credit card transactions, to \\ninformation-filtering systems that learn users' reading preferences, to autonomous \\nvehicles that learn to drive on public highways. At the same time, there have been \\nimportant advances in the theory and algorithms that form the foundations of this \\nfield. \\nThe goal of this textbook is to present the key algorithms and theory that \\nform the core of machine learning. Machine learning draws on concepts and \\nresults from many fields, including statistics, artificial intelligence, philosophy, \\ninformation theory, biology, cognitive science, computational complexity, and \\ncontrol theory. My belief is that the best way to learn about machine learning is \\nto view it from all of these perspectives and to understand the problem settings, \\nalgorithms, and assumptions that underlie each. In the past, this has been difficult \\ndue to the absence of a broad-based single source introduction to the field. The \\nprimary goal of this book is to provide such an introduction. \\nBecause of the interdisciplinary nature of the material, this book makes \\nfew assumptions about the background of the reader. Instead, it introduces basic \\nconcepts from statistics, artificial intelligence, information theory, and other disci- \\nplines as the need arises, focusing on just those concepts most relevant to machine \\nlearning. The book is intended for both undergraduate and graduate students in \\nfields such as computer science, engineering, statistics, and the social sciences, \\nand as a reference for software professionals and practitioners. Two principles \\nthat guided the writing of the book were that it should be accessible to undergrad- \\nuate students and that it should contain the material I would want my own Ph.D. \\nstudents to learn before beginning their doctoral research in machine learning.\"), Document(metadata={'producer': 'macOS Version 11.2.3 (Build 20D91) Quartz PDFContext', 'creator': 'Preview', 'creationdate': \"D:20210312135113Z00'00'\", 'title': 'Machine - Learning - Tom Mitchell.pdf', 'moddate': \"D:20210312135113Z00'00'\", 'source': '..\\\\Data\\\\PDFiles\\\\MachineLearningTomMitchell.pdf', 'total_pages': 421, 'page': 3, 'page_label': '4'}, page_content='xvi PREFACE \\nA third principle that guided the writing of this book was that it should \\npresent a balance of theory and practice. Machine learning theory attempts to an- \\nswer questions such as \"How does learning performance vary with the number of \\ntraining examples presented?\" and \"Which learning algorithms are most appropri- \\nate for various types of learning tasks?\" This book includes discussions of these \\nand other theoretical issues, drawing on theoretical constructs from statistics, com- \\nputational complexity, and Bayesian analysis. The practice of machine learning \\nis covered by presenting the major algorithms in the field, along with illustrative \\ntraces of their operation. Online data sets and implementations of several algo- \\nrithms are available via the World Wide Web at http://www.cs.cmu.edu/-tom1 \\nmlbook.html. These include neural network code and data for face recognition, \\ndecision tree learning, code and data for financial loan analysis, and Bayes clas- \\nsifier code and data for analyzing text documents.

If we could understand how to program them to learn-to improve \\nautomatically with experience-the impact would be dramatic. Imagine comput- \\ners learning from medical records which treatments are most effective for new \\ndiseases, houses learning from experience to optimize energy costs based on the \\nparticular usage patterns of their occupants, or personal software assistants learn- \\ning the evolving interests of their users in order to highlight especially relevant \\nstories from the online morning newspaper. A successful understanding of how to \\nmake computers learn would open up many new uses of computers and new levels \\nof competence and customization. And a detailed understanding of information- \\nprocessing algorithms for machine learning might lead to a better understanding \\nof human learning abilities (and disabilities) as well. \\nWe do not yet know how to make computers learn nearly as well as people \\nlearn. However, algorithms have been invented that are effective for certain types \\nof learning tasks, and a theoretical understanding of learning is beginning to \\nemerge. Many practical computer programs have been developed to exhibit use- \\nful types of learning, and significant commercial applications have begun to ap- \\npear. For problems such as speech recognition, algorithms based on machine \\nlearning outperform all other approaches that have been attempted to date. In \\nthe field known as data mining, machine learning algorithms are being used rou- \\ntinely to discover valuable knowledge from large commercial databases containing \\nequipment maintenance records, loan applications, financial transactions, medical \\nrecords, and the like.

Theoretical results have been developed that characterize the fundamental \\nrelationship among the number of training examples observed, the number of hy- \\npotheses under consideration, and the expected error in learned hypotheses.

In applications, algorithms, theory, and studies of biological \\nsystems, the rate of progress has increased significantly over the past decade. Sev- \\neral recent applications of machine learning are summarized in Table 1.1. Langley \\nand Simon (1995) and Rumelhart et al. (1994) survey additional applications of \\nmachine learning. \\nThis book presents the field of machine learning, describing a variety of \\nlearning paradigms, algorithms, theoretical results, and applications. Machine \\nlearning is inherently a multidisciplinary field. It draws on results from artifi- \\ncial intelligence, probability and statistics, computational complexity theory, con- \\ntrol theory, information theory, philosophy, psychology, neurobiology, and other \\nfields. Table 1.2 summarizes key ideas from each of these fields that impact the \\nfield of machine learning. While the material in this book is based on results from \\nmany diverse fields, the reader need not be an expert in any of them. Key ideas \\nare presented from these fields using a nonspecialist's vocabulary, with unfamiliar \\nterms and concepts introduced as the need arises. \\n1.1 WELL-POSED LEARNING PROBLEMS \\nLet us begin our study of machine learning by considering a few learning tasks. For \\nthe purposes of this book we will define learning broadly, to include any .computer \\nprogram that improves its performance at some task through experience. Put more \\nprecisely, \\nDefinition: A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect \\nto some class of tasks T and performance measure P, if its performance at tasks in \\nT, as measured by P, improves with experience E. \\nFor example, a computer program that learns to play checkers might improve \\nits performance as measured by its abiliry to win at the class of tasks involving \\nplaying checkers games, through experience obtained by playing games against \\nitself.

Neural network \\nlearning methods (e.g., Waibel et al. 1989) and methods for learning hidden Markov models \\n(e.g., Lee 1989) are effective for automatically customizing to,individual speakers, vocabularies, \\nmicrophone characteristics, background noise, etc. Similar techniques have potential applications \\nin many signal-interpretation problems. \\n0 Learning to drive an autonomous vehicle. \\nMachine learning methods have been used to train computer-controlled vehicles to steer correctly \\nwhen driving on a variety of road types. For example, the ALVINN system (Pomerleau 1989) \\nhas used its learned strategies to drive unassisted at 70 miles per hour for 90 miles on public \\nhighways among other cars. Similar techniques have possible applications in many sensor-based \\ncontrol problems. \\n0 Learning to classify new astronomical structures. \\nMachine learning methods have been applied to a variety of large databases to learn general \\nregularities implicit in the data. For example, decision tree learning algorithms have been used \\nby NASA to learn how to classify celestial objects from the second Palomar Observatory Sky \\nSurvey (Fayyad et al. 1995). This system is now used to automatically classify all objects in the \\nSky Survey, which consists of three terrabytes of image data. \\n0 Learning to play world-class backgammon. \\nThe most successful computer programs for playing games such as backgammon are based on \\nmachiie learning algorithms.

Rather than worry about whether this \\ntype of activity falls under the usual informal conversational meaning of the word \\n\"learning,\" we will simply adopt our technical definition of the class of programs \\nthat improve through experience. Within this class we will find many types of \\nproblems that require more or less sophisticated solutions. Our concern here is \\nnot to analyze the meaning of the English word \"learning\" as it is used in ev- \\neryday language. Instead, our goal is to define precisely a class of problems that \\nencompasses interesting forms of learning, to explore algorithms that solve such \\nproblems, and to understand the fundamental structure of learning problems and \\nprocesses. \\n1.2 DESIGNING A LEARNING SYSTEM \\nIn order to illustrate some of the basic design issues and approaches to machine \\nlearning, let us consider designing a program to learn to play checkers, with \\nthe goal of entering it in the world checkers tournament. We adopt the obvious \\nperformance measure: the percent of games it wins in this world tournament. \\n1.2.1 Choosing the Training Experience \\nThe first design choice we face is to choose the type of training experience from \\nwhich our system will learn. The type of training experience available can have a \\nsignificant impact on success or failure of the learner. One key attribute is whether \\nthe training experience provides direct or indirect feedback regarding the choices \\nmade by the performance system. For example, in learning to play checkers, the \\nsystem might learn from direct training examples consisting of individual checkers \\nboard states and the correct move for each. Alternatively, it might have available \\nonly indirect information consisting of the move sequences and final outcomes \\nof various games played. In this later case, information about the correctness \\nof specific moves early in the game must be inferred indirectly from the fact \\nthat the game was eventually won or lost. Here the learner faces an additional \\nproblem of credit assignment, or determining the degree to which each move in \\nthe sequence deserves credit or blame for the final outcome. Credit assignment can \\nbe a particularly difficult problem because the game can be lost even when early \\nmoves are optimal, if these are followed later by poor moves. Hence, learning from \\ndirect training feedback is typically easier than learning from indirect feedback. \\nA second important attribute of the training experience is the degree to which \\nthe learner controls the sequence of training examples. For example, the learner \\nmight rely on the teacher to select informative board states and to provide the \\ncorrect move for each. Alternatively, the learner might itself propose board states \\nthat it finds particularly confusing and ask the teacher for the correct move. Or the \\nlearner may have complete control over both the board states and (indirect) training \\nclassifications, as it does when it learns by playing against itself with no teacher'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'macOS Version 11.2.3 (Build 20D91) Quartz PDFContext', 'creator': 'Preview', 'creationdate': \"D:20210312135113Z00'00'\", 'title': 'Machine - Learning - Tom Mitchell.pdf', 'moddate': \"D:20210312135113Z00'00'\", 'source': '..\\\\Data\\\\PDFiles\\\\MachineLearningTomMitchell.pdf', 'total_pages': 421, 'page': 17, 'page_label': '18'}, page_content=\"present. Notice in this last case the learner may choose between experimenting \\nwith novel board states that it has not yet considered, or honing its skill by playing \\nminor variations of lines of play it currently finds most promising. Subsequent \\nchapters consider a number of settings for learning, including settings in which \\ntraining experience is provided by a random process outside the learner's control, \\nsettings in which the learner may pose various types of queries to an expert teacher, \\nand settings in which the learner collects training examples by autonomously \\nexploring its environment. \\nA third important attribute of the training experience is how well it repre- \\nsents the distribution of examples over which the final system performance P must \\nbe measured. In general, learning is most reliable when the training examples fol- \\nlow a distribution similar to that of future test examples. In our checkers learning \\nscenario, the performance metric P is the percent of games the system wins in \\nthe world tournament. If its training experience E consists only of games played \\nagainst itself, there is an obvious danger that this training experience might not \\nbe fully representative of the distribution of situations over which it will later be \\ntested. For example, the learner might never encounter certain crucial board states \\nthat are very likely to be played by the human checkers champion. In practice, \\nit is often necessary to learn from a distribution of examples that is somewhat \\ndifferent from those on which the final system will be evaluated (e.g., the world \\ncheckers champion might not be interested in teaching the program!). Such situ- \\nations are problematic because mastery of one distribution of examples will not \\nnecessary lead to strong performance over some other distribution. We shall see \\nthat most current theory of machine learning rests on the crucial assumption that \\nthe distribution of training examples is identical to the distribution of test ex- \\namples. Despite our need to make this assumption in order to obtain theoretical \\nresults, it is important to keep in mind that this assumption must often be violated \\nin practice. \\nTo proceed with our design, let us decide that our system will train by \\nplaying games against itself. This has the advantage that no external trainer need \\nbe present, and it therefore allows the system to generate as much training data \\nas time permits. We now have a fully specified learning task. \\nA checkers learning problem: \\n0 Task T: playing checkers \\n0 Performance measure P: percent of games won in the world tournament \\n0 Training experience E: games played against itself \\nIn order to complete the design of the learning system, we must now choose \\n1. the exact type of knowledge to be,learned \\n2. a representation for this target knowledge \\n3. a learning mechanism\"), Document(metadata={'producer': 'macOS Version 11.2.3 (Build 20D91) Quartz PDFContext', 'creator': 'Preview', 'creationdate': \"D:20210312135113Z00'00'\", 'title': 'Machine - Learning - Tom Mitchell.pdf', 'moddate': \"D:20210312135113Z00'00'\", 'source': '..\\\\Data\\\\PDFiles\\\\MachineLearningTomMitchell.pdf', 'total_pages': 421, 'page': 18, 'page_label': '19'}, page_content='CHAFTER I INTRODUCTION 7 \\n1.2.2 Choosing the Target Function \\nThe next design choice is to determine exactly what type of knowledge will be \\nlearned and how this will be used by the performance program. Let us begin with \\na checkers-playing program that can generate the legal moves from any board \\nstate. The program needs only to learn how to choose the best move from among \\nthese legal moves. This learning task is representative of a large class of tasks for \\nwhich the legal moves that define some large search space are known a priori, but \\nfor which the best search strategy is not known. Many optimization problems fall \\ninto this class, such as the problems of scheduling and controlling manufacturing \\nprocesses where the available manufacturing steps are well understood, but the \\nbest strategy for sequencing them is not. \\nGiven this setting where we must learn to choose among the legal moves, \\nthe most obvious choice for the type of information to be learned is a program, \\nor function, that chooses the best move for any given board state. Let us call this \\nfunction ChooseMove and use the notation ChooseMove : B -+ M to indicate \\nthat this function accepts as input any board from the set of legal board states B \\nand produces as output some move from the set of legal moves M. Throughout \\nour discussion of machine learning we will find it useful to reduce the problem \\nof improving performance P at task T to the problem of learning some particu- \\nlar targetfunction such as ChooseMove. The choice of the target function will \\ntherefore be a key design choice. \\nAlthough ChooseMove is an obvious choice for the target function in our \\nexample, this function will turn out to be very difficult to learn given the kind of in- \\ndirect training experience available to our system. An alternative target function- \\nand one that will turn out to be easier to learn in this setting-is an evaluation \\nfunction that assigns a numerical score to any given board state. Let us call this \\ntarget function V and again use the notation V : B + 8 to denote that V maps \\nany legal board state from the set B to some real value (we use 8 to denote the set \\nof real numbers). We intend for this target function V to assign higher scores to \\nbetter board states. If the system can successfully learn such a target function V, \\nthen it can easily use it to select the best move from any current board position. \\nThis can be accomplished by generating the successor board state produced by \\nevery legal move, then using V to choose the best successor state and therefore \\nthe best legal move. \\nWhat exactly should be the value of the target function V for any given \\nboard state? Of course any evaluation function that assigns higher scores to better \\nboard states will do. Nevertheless, we will find it useful to define one particular \\ntarget function V among the many that produce optimal play. As we shall see, \\nthis will make it easier to design a training algorithm. Let us therefore define the \\ntarget value V(b) for an arbitrary board state b in B, as follows: \\n1. if b is a final board state that is won, then V(b) = 100 \\n2. if b is a final board state that is lost, then V(b) = -100 \\n3. if b is a final board state that is drawn, then V(b) = 0'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'macOS Version 11.2.3 (Build 20D91) Quartz PDFContext', 'creator': 'Preview', 'creationdate': \"D:20210312135113Z00'00'\", 'title': 'Machine - Learning - Tom Mitchell.pdf', 'moddate': \"D:20210312135113Z00'00'\", 'source': '..\\\\Data\\\\PDFiles\\\\MachineLearningTomMitchell.pdf', 'total_pages': 421, 'page': 19, 'page_label': '20'}, page_content=\"4. if b is a not a final state in the game, then V(b) = V(bl), where b' is the best \\nfinal board state that can be achieved starting from b and playing optimally \\nuntil the end of the game (assuming the opponent plays optimally, as well). \\nWhile this recursive definition specifies a value of V(b) for every board \\nstate b, this definition is not usable by our checkers player because it is not \\nefficiently computable. Except for the trivial cases (cases 1-3) in which the game \\nhas already ended, determining the value of V(b) for a particular board state \\nrequires (case 4) searching ahead for the optimal line of play, all the way to \\nthe end of the game! Because this definition is not efficiently computable by our \\ncheckers playing program, we say that it is a nonoperational definition. The goal \\nof learning in this case is to discover an operational description of V; that is, a \\ndescription that can be used by the checkers-playing program to evaluate states \\nand select moves within realistic time bounds. \\nThus, we have reduced the learning task in this case to the problem of \\ndiscovering an operational description of the ideal targetfunction V. It may be \\nvery difficult in general to learn such an operational form of V perfectly. In fact, \\nwe often expect learning algorithms to acquire only some approximation to the \\ntarget function, and for this reason the process of learning the target function \\nis often called function approximation. In the current discussion we will use the \\nsymbol ? to refer to the function that is actually learned by our program, to \\ndistinguish it from the ideal target function V. \\n1.23 Choosing a Representation for the Target Function \\nNow that we have specified the ideal target function V, we must choose a repre- \\nsentation that the learning program will use to describe the function c that it will \\nlearn. As with earlier design choices, we again have many options. We could, \\nfor example, allow the program to represent using a large table with a distinct \\nentry specifying the value for each distinct board state. Or we could allow it to \\nrepresent using a collection of rules that match against features of the board \\nstate, or a quadratic polynomial function of predefined board features, or an arti- \\nficial neural network. In general, this choice of representation involves a crucial \\ntradeoff. On one hand, we wish to pick a very expressive representation to allow \\nrepresenting as close an approximation as possible to the ideal target function V. \\nOn the other hand, the more expressive the representation, the more training data \\nthe program will require in order to choose among the alternative hypotheses it \\ncan represent.

In other \\nwords, each training example is an ordered pair of the form (b, V',,,i,(b)).

On the other hand, we require training examples that assign specific scores \\nto specific board states. While it is easy to assign a value to board states that \\ncorrespond to the end of the game, it is less obvious how to assign training values \\nto the more numerous intermediate board states that occur before the game's end. \\nOf course the fact that the game was eventually won or lost does not necessarily \\nindicate that every board state along the game path was necessarily good or bad. \\nFor example, even if the program loses the game, it may still be the case that \\nboard states occurring early in the game should be rated very highly and that the \\ncause of the loss was a subsequent poor move. \\nDespite the ambiguity inherent in estimating training values for intermediate \\nboard states, one simple approach has been found to be surprisingly successful. \\nThis approach is to assign the training value of Krain(b) for any intermediate board \\nstate b to be ?(~uccessor(b)), where ? is the learner's current approximation to \\nV and where Successor(b) denotes the next board state following b for which it \\nis again the program's turn to move (i.e., the board state following the program's \\nmove and the opponent's response). This rule for estimating training values can \\nbe summarized as \\n~ulk for estimating training values. \\nV,,,i.

In- \\ntuitively, we can see this will make sense if ? tends to be more accurate for board \\nstates closer to game's end. In fact, under certain conditions (discussed in Chap- \\nter 13) the approach of iteratively estimating training values based on estimates of \\nsuccessor state values can be proven to converge toward perfect estimates of Vtrain. \\n1.2.4.2 ADJUSTING THE WEIGHTS \\nAll that remains is to specify the learning algorithm for choosing the weights wi  to^ \\nbest fit the set of training examples {(b, Vtrain(b))}. As a first step we must define \\nwhat we mean by the bestfit to the training data. One common approach is to \\ndefine the best hypothesis, or set of weights, as that which minimizes the squarg \\nerror E between the training values and the values predicted by the hypothesis V.\"), Document(metadata={'producer': 'macOS Version 11.2.3 (Build 20D91) Quartz PDFContext', 'creator': 'Preview', 'creationdate': \"D:20210312135113Z00'00'\", 'title': 'Machine - Learning - Tom Mitchell.pdf', 'moddate': \"D:20210312135113Z00'00'\", 'source': '..\\\\Data\\\\PDFiles\\\\MachineLearningTomMitchell.pdf', 'total_pages': 421, 'page': 22, 'page_label': '23'}, page_content='Thus, we seek the weights, or equivalently the c, that minimize E for the observed \\ntraining examples. Chapter 6 discusses settings in which minimizing the sum of \\nsquared errors is equivalent to finding the most probable hypothesis given the \\nobserved training data. \\nSeveral algorithms are known for finding weights of a linear function that \\nminimize E defined in this way. In our case, we require an algorithm that will \\nincrementally refine the weights as new training examples become available and \\nthat will be robust to errors in these estimated training values. One such algorithm \\nis called the least mean squares, or LMS training rule. For each observed training \\nexample it adjusts the weights a small amount in the direction that reduces the \\nerror on this training example. As discussed in Chapter 4, this algorithm can be \\nviewed as performing a stochastic gradient-descent search through the space of \\npossible hypotheses (weight values) to minimize the squared enor E. The LMS \\nalgorithm is defined as follows: \\nLMS weight update rule. \\nFor each training example (b, Kmin(b)) \\nUse the current weights to calculate ?(b) \\nFor each weight mi, update it as \\nHere q is a small constant (e.g., 0.1) that moderates the size of the weight update. \\nTo get an intuitive understanding for why this weight update rule works, notice \\nthat when the error (Vtrain(b) - c(b)) is zero, no weights are changed. When \\n(V,,ain(b) - e(b)) is positive (i.e., when f(b) is too low), then each weight is \\nincreased in proportion to the value of its corresponding feature. This will raise \\nthe value of ?(b), reducing the error. Notice that if the value of some feature \\nxi is zero, then its weight is not altered regardless of the error, so that the only \\nweights updated are those whose features actually occur on the training example \\nboard.

These four modules, summarized in Figure 1.1, are as follows: \\n0 The Performance System is the module that must solve the given per- \\nformance task, in this case playing checkers, by using the learned target \\nfunction(s).

In our example, the Critic corresponds to the training rule given \\nby Equation (1.1). \\nThe Generalizer takes as input the training examples and produces an output \\nhypothesis that is its estimate of the target function.

The question then arises as to whether this learning \\ntechnique is guaranteed to find one. Chapter 13 provides a theoretical analysis \\nshowing that under rather restrictive assumptions, variations on this approach \\ndo indeed converge to the desired evaluation function for certain types of search \\nproblems. Fortunately, practical experience indicates that this approach to learning \\nevaluation functions is often successful, even outside the range of situations for \\nwhich such guarantees can be proven. \\nWould the program we have designed be able to learn well enough to beat \\nthe human checkers world champion? Probably not. In part, this is because the \\nlinear function representation for ? is too simple a representation to capture well \\nthe nuances of the game. However, given a more sophisticated representation for \\nthe target function, this general approach can, in fact, be quite successful. For \\nexample, Tesauro (1992, 1995) reports a similar design for a program that learns \\nto play the game of backgammon, by learning a very similar evaluation function \\nover states of the game. His program represents the learned evaluation function \\nusing an artificial neural network that considers the complete description of the \\nboard state rather than a subset of board features. After training on over one million \\nself-generated training games, his program was able to play very competitively \\nwith top-ranked human backgammon players. \\nOf course we could have designed many alternative algorithms for this \\ncheckers learning task. One might, for example, simply store the given training \\nexamples, then try to find the \"closest\" stored situation to match any new situation \\n(nearest neighbor algorithm, Chapter 8). Or we might generate a large number of \\ncandidate checkers programs and allow them to play against each other, keep- \\ning only the most successful programs and further elaborating or mutating these \\nin a kind of simulated evolution (genetic algorithms, Chapter 9). Humans seem \\nto follow yet a different approach to learning strategies, in which they analyze, \\nor explain to themselves, the reasons underlying specific successes and failures \\nencountered during play (explanation-based learning, Chapter 11). Our design is \\nsimply one of many, presented here to ground our discussion of the decisions that \\nmust go into designing a learning method for a specific class of tasks. \\n1.3 PERSPECTIVES AND ISSUES IN MACHINE LEARNING \\nOne useful perspective on machine learning is that it involves searching a very \\nlarge space of possible hypotheses to determine one that best fits the observed data \\nand any prior knowledge held by the learner. For example, consider the space of \\nhypotheses that could in principle be output by the above checkers learner.

This chapter considers concept learning: acquiring the definition of a \\ngeneral category given a sample of positive and negative training examples of the \\ncategory. Concept learning can be formulated as a problem of searching through a \\npredefined space of potential hypotheses for the hypothesis that best fits the train- \\ning examples. In many cases this search can be efficiently organized by taking \\nadvantage of a naturally occurring structure over the hypothesis space-a general- \\nto-specific ordering of hypotheses.

People, for example, continually learn general concepts or categories such \\nas \"bird,\" \"car,\" \"situations in which I should study more in order to pass the \\nexam,\" etc. Each such concept can be viewed as describing some subset of ob- \\njects or events defined over a larger set (e.g., the subset of animals that constitute'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'macOS Version 11.2.3 (Build 20D91) Quartz PDFContext', 'creator': 'Preview', 'creationdate': \"D:20210312135113Z00'00'\", 'title': 'Machine - Learning - Tom Mitchell.pdf', 'moddate': \"D:20210312135113Z00'00'\", 'source': '..\\\\Data\\\\PDFiles\\\\MachineLearningTomMitchell.pdf', 'total_pages': 421, 'page': 32, 'page_label': '33'}, page_content='CHAFER 2 CONCEm LEARNING AND THE GENERAL-TO-SPECIFIC ORDERWG 21 \\nbirds). Alternatively, each concept can be thought of as a boolean-valued function \\ndefined over this larger set (e.g., a function defined over all animals, whose value \\nis true for birds and false for other animals). \\nIn this chapter we consider the problem of automatically inferring the general \\ndefinition of some concept, given examples labeled as+.members or nonmembers \\nof the concept. This task is commonly referred to as concept learning, or approx- \\nimating a boolean-valued function from examples. \\nConcept learning. Inferring a boolean-valued function from training examples of \\nits input and output. \\n2.2 A CONCEPT LEARNING TASK \\nTo ground our discussion of concept learning, consider the example task of learn- \\ning the target concept \"days on which my friend Aldo enjoys his favorite water \\nsport.\" Table 2.1 describes a set of example days, each represented by a set of \\nattributes. The attribute EnjoySport indicates whether or not Aldo enjoys his \\nfavorite water sport on this day. The task is to learn to predict the value of \\nEnjoySport for an arbitrary day, based on the values of its other attributes. \\nWhat hypothesis representation shall we provide to the learner in this case? \\nLet us begin by considering a simple representation in which each hypothesis \\nconsists of a conjunction of constraints on the instance attributes. In particular, \\nlet each hypothesis be a vector of six constraints, specifying the values of the six \\nattributes Sky, AirTemp, Humidity, Wind, Water, and Forecast. For each attribute, \\nthe hypothesis will either \\n0 indicate by a \"?\\' that any value is acceptable for this attribute, \\n0 specify a single required value (e.g., Warm) for the attribute, or \\n0 indicate by a \"0\" that no value is acceptable. \\nIf some instance x satisfies all the constraints of hypothesis h, then h clas- \\nsifies x as a positive example (h(x) = 1). To illustrate, the hypothesis that Aldo \\nenjoys his favorite sport only on cold days with high humidity (independent of \\nthe values of the other attributes) is represented by the expression \\n(?, Cold, High, ?, ?, ?) \\nExample Sky AirTemp Humidity Wind Water Forecast EnjoySport \\n1 Sunny Warm Normal Strong Warm Same Yes \\n2 Sunny Warm High Strong Warm Same Yes \\n3 Rainy Cold High Strong Warm Change No \\n4 Sunny Warm High Strong Cool Change Yes \\nTABLE 2.1 \\nPositive and negative training examples for the target concept EnjoySport.'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'macOS Version 11.2.3 (Build 20D91) Quartz PDFContext', 'creator': 'Preview', 'creationdate': \"D:20210312135113Z00'00'\", 'title': 'Machine - Learning - Tom Mitchell.pdf', 'moddate': \"D:20210312135113Z00'00'\", 'source': '..\\\\Data\\\\PDFiles\\\\MachineLearningTomMitchell.pdf', 'total_pages': 421, 'page': 33, 'page_label': '34'}, page_content='22 MACHINE LEARNING \\nThe most general hypothesis-that every day is a positive example-is repre- \\nsented by \\n(?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?) \\nand the most specific possible hypothesis-that no day is a positive example-is \\nrepresented by \\n(0,0,0,0,0,0) \\nTo summarize, the EnjoySport concept learning task requires learning the \\nset of days for which EnjoySport = yes, describing this set by a conjunction \\nof constraints over the instance attributes. In general, any concept learning task \\ncan be described by the set of instances over which the target function is defined, \\nthe target function, the set of candidate hypotheses considered by the learner, and \\nthe set of available training examples. The definition of the EnjoySport concept \\nlearning task in this general form is given in Table 2.2. \\n2.2.1 Notation \\nThroughout this book, we employ the following terminology when discussing \\nconcept learning problems. The set of items over which the concept is defined \\nis called the set of instances, which we denote by X. In the current example, X \\nis the set of all possible days, each represented by the attributes Sky, AirTemp, \\nHumidity, Wind, Water, and Forecast. The concept or function to be learned is \\ncalled the target concept, which we denote by c. In general, c can be any boolean- \\nvalued function defined over the instances X; that is, c : X + {O, 1). In the current \\nexample, the target concept corresponds to the value of the attribute EnjoySport \\n(i.e., c(x) = 1 if EnjoySport = Yes, and c(x) = 0 if EnjoySport = No). \\n- \\n0 Given: \\n0 Instances X: Possible days, each described by the attributes \\n0 Sky (with possible values Sunny, Cloudy, and Rainy), \\n0 AirTemp (with values Warm and Cold), \\n0 Humidity (with values Normal and High), \\n0 Wind (with values Strong and Weak), \\n0 Water (with values Warm and Cool), and \\n0 Forecast (with values Same and Change). \\n0 Hypotheses H: Each hypothesis is described by a conjunction of constraints on the at- \\ntributes Sky, AirTemp, Humidity, Wind, Water, and Forecast. The constraints may be \"?\" \\n(any value is acceptable), \"0 (no value is acceptable), or a specific value. \\n0 Target concept c: EnjoySport : X + (0,l) \\n0 Training examples D: Positive and negative examples of the target function (see Table 2.1). \\n0 Determine: \\n0 A hypothesis h in H such that h(x) = c(x) for all x in X. \\nTABLE 2.2 \\nThe EnjoySport concept learning task.'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'macOS Version 11.2.3 (Build 20D91) Quartz PDFContext', 'creator': 'Preview', 'creationdate': \"D:20210312135113Z00'00'\", 'title': 'Machine - Learning - Tom Mitchell.pdf', 'moddate': \"D:20210312135113Z00'00'\", 'source': '..\\\\Data\\\\PDFiles\\\\MachineLearningTomMitchell.pdf', 'total_pages': 421, 'page': 34, 'page_label': '35'}, page_content='When learning the target concept, the learner is presented a set of training \\nexamples, each consisting of an instance x from X, along with its target concept \\nvalue c(x) (e.g., the training examples in Table 2.1). Instances for which c(x) = 1 \\nare called positive examples, or members of the target concept. Instances for which \\nC(X) = 0 are called negative examples, or nonmembers of the target concept. \\nWe will often write the ordered pair (x, c(x)) to describe the training example \\nconsisting of the instance x and its target concept value c(x). We use the symbol \\nD to denote the set of available training examples. \\nGiven a set of training examples of the target concept c, the problem faced \\nby the learner is to hypothesize, or estimate, c. We use the symbol H to denote \\nthe set of all possible hypotheses that the learner may consider regarding the \\nidentity of the target concept. Usually H is determined by the human designer\\'s \\nchoice of hypothesis representation. In general, each hypothesis h in H represents \\na boolean-valued function defined over X; that is, h : X --+ {O, 1). The goal of the \\nlearner is to find a hypothesis h such that h(x) = c(x) for a\" x in X. \\n2.2.2 The Inductive Learning Hypothesis \\nNotice that although the learning task is to determine a hypothesis h identical \\nto the target concept c over the entire set of instances X, the only information \\navailable about c is its value over the training examples. Therefore, inductive \\nlearning algorithms can at best guarantee that the output hypothesis fits the target \\nconcept over the training data. Lacking any further information, our assumption \\nis that the best hypothesis regarding unseen instances is the hypothesis that best \\nfits the observed training data. This is the fundamental assumption of inductive \\nlearning, and we will have much more to say about it throughout this book. We \\nstate it here informally and will revisit and analyze this assumption more formally \\nand more quantitatively in Chapters 5, 6, and 7. \\nThe inductive learning hypothesis.

The goal of this \\nsearch is to find the hypothesis that best fits the training examples. It is important \\nto note that by selecting a hypothesis representation, the designer of the learning \\nalgorithm implicitly defines the space of all hypotheses that the program can \\never represent and therefore can ever learn.

Therefore, the \\nnumber of semantically distinct hypotheses is only 1 + (4.3.3.3.3.3) = 973. Our \\nEnjoySport example is a very simple learning task, with a relatively small, finite \\nhypothesis space. Most practical learning tasks involve much larger, sometimes \\ninfinite, hypothesis spaces. \\nIf we view learning as a search problem, then it is natural that our study \\nof learning algorithms will exa~the different strategies for searching the hypoth- \\nesis space.

By taking advantage of this \\nnaturally occurring structure over the hypothesis space, we can design learning \\nalgorithms that exhaustively search even infinite hypothesis spaces without explic- \\nitly enumerating every hypothesis. To illustrate the general-to-specific ordering, \\nconsider the two hypotheses \\nhi = (Sunny, ?, ?, Strong, ?, ?) \\nh2 = (Sunny, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?) \\nNow consider the sets of instances that are classified positive by hl and by h2. \\nBecause h2 imposes fewer constraints on the instance, it classifies more instances \\nas positive. In fact, any instance classified positive by hl will also be classified \\npositive by h2. Therefore, we say that h2 is more general than hl. \\nThis intuitive \"more general than\" relationship between hypotheses can be \\ndefined more precisely as follows. First, for any instance x in X and hypothesis \\nh in H, we say that x satisjies h if and only if h(x) = 1. We now define the \\nmore-general~han_or.-equal~o relation in terms of the sets of instances that sat- \\nisfy the two hypotheses: Given hypotheses hj and hk, hj is more-general-thanm-- \\nequaldo hk if and only if any instance that satisfies hk also satisfies hi. \\nDefinition: Let hj and hk be boolean-valued functions defined over X.

One way is to begin \\nwith the most specific possible hypothesis in H, then generalize this hypothesis \\neach time it fails to cover an observed positive training example. (We say that \\na hypothesis \"covers\" a positive example if it correctly classifies the example as \\npositive.) To be more precise about how the partial ordering is used, consider the \\nFIND-S algorithm defined in Table 2.3. \\nTo illustrate this algorithm, assume the learner is given the sequence of \\ntraining examples from Table 2.1 for the EnjoySport task. The first step of FIND- \\nS is to initialize h to the most specific hypothesis in H \\nUpon observing the first training example from Table 2.1, which happens to be a \\npositive example, it becomes clear that our hypothesis is too specific. In particular, \\nnone of the \"0\" constraints in h are satisfied by this example, so each is replaced \\nby the next more general constraint {hat fits the example; namely, the attribute \\nvalues for this training example. \\nh -+ (Sunny, Warm, Normal, Strong, Warm, Same) \\nThis h is still very specific; it asserts that all instances are negative except for \\nthe single positive training example we have observed. Next, the second training \\nexample (also positive in this case) forces the algorithm to further generalize h, \\nthis time substituting a \"?\\' in place of any attribute value in h that is not satisfied \\nby the new example. The refined hypothesis in this case is \\nh -+ (Sunny, Warm, ?, Strong, Warm, Same) \\nUpon encountering the third training example-in this case a negative exam- \\nple-the algorithm makes no change to h. In fact, the FIND-S algorithm simply \\nignores every negative example!

In the general case, as long as we assume that the hypothesis space H \\ncontains a hypothesis that describes the true target concept c and that the training \\ndata contains no errors, then the current hypothesis h can never require a revision \\nin response to a negative example. To see why, recall that the current hypothesis \\nh is the most specific hypothesis in H consistent with the observed positive exam- \\nples. Because the target concept c is also assumed to be in H and to be consistent \\nwith the positive training examples, c must be more.general_than-or-equaldo h. \\nBut the target concept c will never cover a negative example, thus neither will \\nh (by the definition of more-general~han). Therefore, no revision to h will be \\nrequired in response to any negative example. \\nTo complete our trace of FIND-S, the fourth (positive) example leads to a \\nfurther generalization of h \\nh t (Sunny, Warm, ?, Strong, ?, ?) \\nThe FIND-S algorithm illustrates one way in which the more-generaldhan \\npartial ordering can be used to organize the search for an acceptable hypothe- \\nsis. The search moves from hypothesis to hypothesis, searching from the most \\nspecific to progressively more general hypotheses along one chain of the partial \\nordering. Figure 2.2 illustrates this search in terms of the instance and hypoth- \\nesis spaces. At each step, the hypothesis is generalized only as far as neces- \\nsary to cover the new positive example.

A number of \\nsuch algorithms are discussed in this chapter, and several others are presented in \\nChapter 10. \\nThe key property of the FIND-S algorithm is that for hypothesis spaces de- \\nscribed by conjunctions of attribute constraints (such as H for the EnjoySport \\ntask), FIND-S is guaranteed to output the most specific hypothesis within H \\nthat is consistent with the positive training examples. Its final hypothesis will \\nalso be consistent with the negative examples provided the correct target con- \\ncept is contained in H, and provided the training examples are correct. How- \\never, there are several questions still left unanswered by this learning algorithm, \\nsuch as: \\nHas the learner converged to the correct target concept? Although FIND-S \\nwill find a hypothesis consistent with the training data, it has no way to \\ndetermine whether it has found the only hypothesis in H consistent with \\nthe data (i.e., the correct target concept), or whether there are many other \\nconsistent hypotheses as well. We would prefer a learning algorithm that \\ncould determine whether it had converged and, if not, at least characterize \\nits uncertainty regarding the true identity of the target concept. \\n0 Why prefer the most specific hypothesis? In case there are multiple hypothe- \\nses consistent with the training examples, FIND-S will find the most specific. \\nIt is unclear whether we should prefer this hypothesis over, say, the most \\ngeneral, or some other hypothesis of intermediate generality. \\n0 Are the training examples consistent? In most practical learning problems \\nthere is some chance that the training examples will contain at least some \\nerrors or noise. Such inconsistent sets of training examples can severely \\nmislead FIND-S, given the fact that it ignores negative examples. We would \\nprefer an algorithm that could at least detect when the training data is in- \\nconsistent and, preferably, accommodate such errors. \\n0 What if there are several maximally specific consistent hypotheses? In the \\nhypothesis language H for the EnjoySport task, there is always a unique, \\nmost specific hypothesis consistent with any set of positive examples. How- \\never, for other hypothesis spaces (discussed later) there can be several maxi- \\nmally specific hypotheses consistent with the data. In this case, FIND-S must \\nbe extended to allow it to backtrack on its choices of how to generalize the \\nhypothesis, to accommodate the possibility that the target concept lies along \\na different branch of the partial ordering than the branch it has selected.

Notice \\nthat although FIND-S outputs a hypothesis from H,that is consistent with the \\ntraining examples, this is just one of many hypotheses from H that might fit the \\ntraining data equally well. The key idea in the CANDIDATE-ELIMINATION algorithm \\nis to output a description of the set of all hypotheses consistent with the train- \\ning examples. Surprisingly, the CANDIDATE-ELIMINATION algorithm computes the \\ndescription of this set without explicitly enumerating all of its members. This is \\naccomplished by again using the more-general-than partial ordering, this time \\nto maintain a compact representation of the set of consistent hypotheses and to \\nincrementally refine this representation as each new training example is encoun- \\ntered. \\nThe CANDIDATE-ELIMINATION algorithm has been applied to problems such \\nas learning regularities in chemical mass spectroscopy (Mitchell 1979) and learn- \\ning control rules for heuristic search (Mitchell et al. 1983).

In the remainder of this chapter we present the algo- \\nrithm and discuss these issues. Beginning with the next chapter, we will ex- \\namine learning algorithms that are used more frequently with noisy training \\ndata. \\n2.5.1 Representation \\nThe CANDIDATE-ELIMINATION algorithm finds all describable hypotheses that are \\nconsistent with the observed training examples. In order to define this algorithm \\nprecisely, we begin with a few basic definitions. First, let us say that a hypothesis \\nis consistent with the training examples if it correctly classifies these examples. \\nDefinition: A hypothesis h is consistent with a set of training examples D if and \\nonly if h(x) = c(x) for each example (x, c(x)) in D. \\nNotice the key difference between this definition of consistent and our earlier \\ndefinition of satisfies. An example x is said to satisfy hypothesis h when h(x) = 1, \\nregardless of whether x is a positive or negative example of the target concept. \\nHowever, whether such an example is consistent with h depends on the target \\nconcept, and in particular, whether h(x) = c(x). \\nThe CANDIDATE-ELIMINATION algorithm represents the set of all hypotheses \\nconsistent with the observed training examples.

In fact, as new training examples \\nare observed, the version space can be monitored to determine the remaining am- \\nbiguity regarding the true target concept and to determine when sufficient training \\nexamples have been observed to unambiguously identify the target concept. The \\ntarget concept is exactly learned when the S and G boundary sets converge to a \\nsingle, identical, hypothesis. \\nWhat will happen if the training data contains errors? Suppose, for example, \\nthat the second training example above is incorrectly presented as a negative \\nexample instead of a positive example. Unfortunately, in this case the algorithm \\nis certain to remove the correct target concept from the version space! Because, \\nit will remove every hypothesis that is inconsistent with each training example, it \\nwill eliminate the true target concept from the version space as soon as this false \\nnegative example is encountered. Of course, given sufficient additional training \\ndata the learner will eventually detect an inconsistency by noticing that the S and \\nG boundary sets eventually converge to an empty version space. Such an empty \\nversion space indicates that there is no hypothesis in H consistent with all observed \\ntraining examples. A similar symptom will appear when the training examples are \\ncorrect, but the target concept cannot be described in the hypothesis representation \\n(e.g., if the target concept is a disjunction of feature attributes and the hypothesis \\nspace supports only conjunctive descriptions). We will consider such eventualities \\nin greater detail later. For now, we consider only the case in which the training \\nexamples are correct and the true target concept is present in the hypothesis space. \\n2.6.2 What Training Example Should the Learner Request Next? \\nUp to this point we have assumed that training examples are provided to the \\nlearner by some external teacher. Suppose instead that the learner is allowed to \\nconduct experiments in which it chooses the next instance, then obtains the correct \\nclassification for this instance from an external oracle (e.g., nature or a teacher). \\nThis scenario covers situations in which the learner may conduct experiments in \\nnature (e.g., build new bridges and allow nature to classify them as stable or \\nunstable), or in which a teacher is available to provide the correct classification \\n(e.g., propose a new bridge and allow the teacher to suggest whether or not it will \\nbe stable). We use the term query to refer to such instances constructed by the \\nlearner, which are then classified by an external oracle. \\nConsider again the version space learned from the four training examples \\nof the Enjoysport concept and illustrated in Figure 2.3.

Clearly, the learner should attempt to discriminate among the alternative \\ncompeting hypotheses in its current version space. Therefore, it should choose \\nan instance that would be classified positive by some of these hypotheses, but \\nnegative by others. One such instance is \\n(Sunny, Warm, Normal, Light, Warm, Same) \\nNote that this instance satisfies three of the six hypotheses in the current \\nversion space (Figure 2.3). If the trainer classifies this instance as a positive ex- \\nample, the S boundary of the version space can then be generalized. Alternatively, \\nif the trainer indicates that this is a negative example, the G boundary can then be \\nspecialized. Either way, the learner will succeed in learning more about the true \\nidentity of the target concept, shrinking the version space from six hypotheses to \\nhalf this number. \\nIn general, the optimal query strategy for a concept learner is to generate \\ninstances that satisfy exactly half the hypotheses in the current version space. \\nWhen this is possible, the size of the version space is reduced by half with each \\nnew example, and the correct target concept can therefore be found with only \\nrlog2JVS11 experiments. The situation is analogous to playing the game twenty \\nquestions, in which the goal is to ask yes-no questions to determine the correct \\nhypothesis. The optimal strategy for playing twenty questions is to ask questions \\nthat evenly split the candidate hypotheses into sets that predict yes and no. While \\nwe have seen that it is possible to generate an instance that satisfies precisely \\nhalf the hypotheses in the version space of Figure 2.3, in general it may not be \\npossible to construct an instance that matches precisely half the hypotheses.

Even though the version space of Figure 2.3 still \\ncontains multiple hypotheses, indicating that the target concept has not yet been \\nfully learned, it is possible to classify certain examples with the same degree of \\nconfidence as if the target concept had been uniquely identified.

An efficient test for this condition is that the \\ninstance satisfies none of the members of G (why?). \\nInstance C presents a different situation. Half of the version space hypotheses \\nclassify it as positive and half classify it as negative.

In this case we require a more \\nexpressive hypothesis space. \\n2.7.2 An Unbiased Learner \\nThe obvious solution to the problem of assuring that the target concept is in the \\nhypothesis space H is to provide a hypothesis space capable of representing every \\nteachable concept; that is, it is capable of representing every possible subset of the \\ninstances X.

In fact, \\nthe only reason that the CANDIDATE-ELIMINATION algorithm was able to gener- \\nalize beyond the observed training examples in our original formulation of the \\nEnjoySport task is that it was biased by the implicit assumption that the target \\nconcept could be represented by a conjunction of attribute values. In cases where \\nthis assumption is correct (and the training examples are error-free), its classifica- \\ntion of new instances will also be correct. If this assumption is incorrect, however, \\nit is certain that the CANDIDATE-ELIMINATION algorithm will rnisclassify at least \\nsome instances from X. \\nBecause inductive learning requires some form of prior assumptions, or \\ninductive bias, we will find it useful to characterize different learning approaches \\nby the inductive biast they employ. Let us define this notion of inductive bias \\nmore precisely. The key idea we wish to capture here is the policy by which the \\nlearner generalizes beyond the observed training data, to infer the classification \\nof new instances. Therefore, consider the general setting in which an arbitrary \\nlearning algorithm L is provided an arbitrary set of training data D, = {(x, c(x))} \\nof some arbitrary target concept c. After training, L is asked to classify a new \\ninstance xi. Let L(xi, D,) denote the classification (e.g., positive or negative) that \\nL assigns to xi after learning from the training data D,. We can describe this \\ninductive inference step performed by L as follows \\nwhere the notation y + z indicates that z is inductively inferred from y. For \\nexample, if we take L to be the CANDIDATE-ELIMINATION algorithm, D, to be \\nthe training data from Table 2.1, and xi to be the fist instance from Table 2.6, \\nthen the inductive inference performed in this case concludes that L(xi, D,) = \\n(EnjoySport = yes). \\nBecause L is an inductive learning algorithm, the result L(xi, D,) that it in- \\nfers will not in general be provably correct; that is, the classification L(xi, D,) need \\nnot follow deductively from the training data D, and the description of the new \\ninstance xi. However, it is interesting to ask what additional assumptions could be \\nadded to D, r\\\\xi so that L(xi, D,) would follow deductively. We define the induc- \\ntive bias of L as this set of additional assumptions. More precisely, we define the \\nt~he term inductive bias here is not to be confused with the term estimation bias commonly used in \\nstatistics.

To summarize, \\nDefinition: Consider a concept learning algorithm L for the set of instances X. Let \\nc be an arbitrary concept defined over X, and let D, = ((x, c(x))} be an arbitrary \\nset of training examples of c. Let L(xi, D,) denote the classification assigned to \\nthe instance xi by L after training on the data D,. The inductive bias of L is any \\nminimal set of assertions B such that for any target concept c and corresponding \\ntraining examples Dc \\n(Vxi E X)[(B A Dc A xi) k L(xi, D,)] (2.1) \\nWhat, then, is the inductive bias of the CANDIDATE-ELIMINATION algorithm? \\nTo answer this, let us specify L(xi, D,) exactly for this algorithm: given a set \\nof data D,, the CANDIDATE-ELIMINATION algorithm will first compute the version \\nspace VSH,D,, then classify the new instance xi by a vote among hypotheses in this \\nversion space. Here let us assume that it will output a classification for xi only if \\nthis vote among version space hypotheses is unanimously positive or negative and \\nthat it will not output a classification otherwise. Given this definition of L(xi, D,) \\nfor the CANDIDATE-ELIMINATION algorithm, what is its inductive bias? It is simply \\nthe assumption c E H. Given this assumption, each inductive inference performed \\nby the CANDIDATE-ELIMINATION algorithm can be justified deductively. \\nTo see why the classification L(xi, D,) follows deductively from B = {c E \\nH), together with the data D, and description of the instance xi, consider the fol- \\nlowing argument. First, notice that if we assume c E H then it follows deductively \\nthat c E VSH,Dc. This follows from c E H, from the definition of the version space \\nVSH,D, as the set of all hypotheses in H that are consistent with D,, and from our \\ndefinition of D, = {(x, c(x))} as training data consistent with the target concept \\nc. Second, recall that we defined the classification L(xi, D,) to be the unanimous \\nvote of all hypotheses in the version space. Thus, if L outputs the classification \\nL(x,, D,), it must be the case the every hypothesis in VSH,~, also produces this \\nclassification, including the hypothesis c E VSHYDc. Therefore c(xi) = L(xi, D,). \\nTo summarize, the CANDIDATE-ELIMINATION algorithm defined in this fashion can \\nbe characterized by the following bias \\nInductive bias of CANDIDATE-ELIMINATION algorithm.

This version space of alternative \\nhypotheses can be examined to determine whether the learner has converged \\nto the target concept, to determine when the training data are inconsistent, \\nto generate informative queries to further refine the version space, and to \\ndetermine which unseen instances can be unambiguously classified based on \\nthe partially learned concept. \\nVersion spaces and the CANDIDATE-ELIMINATION algorithm provide a useful \\nconceptual framework for studying concept learning. However, this learning \\nalgorithm is not robust to noisy data or to situations in which the unknown \\ntarget concept is not expressible in the provided hypothesis space. Chap- \\nter 10 describes several concept learning algorithms based on the general- \\nto-specific ordering, which are robust to noisy data. \\n0 Inductive learning algorithms are able to classify unseen examples only be- \\ncause of their implicit inductive bias for selecting one consistent hypothesis \\nover another.

Smith and Rosenbloom (1990) show a simple change to the repre- \\nsentation of the G set that can improve complexity in certain cases, and Hirsh \\n(1992) shows that learning can be polynomial in the number of examples in some \\ncases when the G set is not stored at all.

Instances are described by \\na fixed set of attributes (e.g., Temperature) and their values (e.g., Hot). The \\neasiest situation for decision tree learning is when each attribute takes on a \\nsmall number of disjoint possible values (e.g., Hot, Mild, Cold). However, \\nextensions to the basic algorithm (discussed in Section 3.7.2) allow handling \\nreal-valued attributes as well (e.g., representing Temperature numerically). \\nThe targetfunction has discrete output values. The decision tree in Figure 3.1 \\nassigns a boolean classification (e.g., yes or no) to each example. Decision \\ntree methods easily extend to learning functions with more than two possible \\noutput values. A more substantial extension allows learning target functions \\nwith real-valued outputs, though the application of decision trees in this \\nsetting is less common. \\n0 Disjunctive descriptions may be required. As noted above, decision trees \\nnaturally represent disjunctive expressions. \\n0 The training data may contain errors. Decision tree learning methods are \\nrobust to errors, both errors in classifications of the training examples and \\nerrors in the attribute values that describe these examples. \\n0 The training data may contain missing attribute values. Decision tree meth- \\nods can be used even when some training examples have unknown values \\n(e.g., if the Humidity of the day is known for only some of the training \\nexamples). This issue is discussed in Section 3.7.4. \\nMany practical problems have been found to fit these characteristics. De- \\ncision tree learning has therefore been applied to problems such as learning to \\nclassify medical patients by their disease, equipment malfunctions by their cause, \\nand loan applicants by their likelihood of defaulting on payments. Such problems, \\nin which the task is to classify examples into one of a discrete set of possible \\ncategories, are often referred to as classijication problems. \\nThe remainder of this chapter is organized as follows. Section 3.4 presents \\nthe basic ID3 algorithm for learning decision trees and illustrates its operation \\nin detail. Section 3.5 examines the hypothesis space search performed by this \\nlearning algorithm, contrasting it with algorithms from Chapter 2. Section 3.6 \\ncharacterizes the inductive bias of this decision tree learning algorithm and ex- \\nplores more generally an inductive bias called Occam's razor, which corresponds \\nto a preference for the most simple hypothesis. Section 3.7 discusses the issue of \\noverfitting the training data, as well as strategies such as rule post-pruning to deal \\nwith this problem. This section also discusses a number of more advanced topics \\nsuch as extending the algorithm to accommodate real-valued attributes, training \\ndata with unobserved attributes, and attributes with differing costs.\"), Document(metadata={'producer': 'macOS Version 11.2.3 (Build 20D91) Quartz PDFContext', 'creator': 'Preview', 'creationdate': \"D:20210312135113Z00'00'\", 'title': 'Machine - Learning - Tom Mitchell.pdf', 'moddate': \"D:20210312135113Z00'00'\", 'source': '..\\\\Data\\\\PDFiles\\\\MachineLearningTomMitchell.pdf', 'total_pages': 421, 'page': 66, 'page_label': '67'}, page_content='CHAPTER 3 DECISION TREE LEARMNG 55 \\n3.4 THE BASIC DECISION TREE LEARNING ALGORITHM \\nMost algorithms that have been developed for learning decision trees are vari- \\nations on a core algorithm that employs a top-down, greedy search through the \\nspace of possible decision trees. This approach is exemplified by the ID3 algorithm \\n(Quinlan 1986) and its successor C4.5 (Quinlan 1993), which form the primary \\nfocus of our discussion here. In this section we present the basic algorithm for \\ndecision tree learning, corresponding approximately to the ID3 algorithm. In Sec- \\ntion 3.7 we consider a number of extensions to this basic algorithm, including \\nextensions incorporated into C4.5 and other more recent algorithms for decision \\ntree learning. \\nOur basic algorithm, ID3, learns decision trees by constructing them top- \\ndown, beginning with the question \"which attribute should be tested at the root \\nof the tree?\\'To answer this question, each instance attribute is evaluated using \\na statistical test to determine how well it alone classifies the training examples. \\nThe best attribute is selected and used as the test at the root node of the tree. \\nA descendant of the root node is then created for each possible value of this \\nattribute, and the training examples are sorted to the appropriate descendant node \\n(i.e., down the branch corresponding to the example\\'s value for this attribute). \\nThe entire process is then repeated using the training examples associated with \\neach descendant node to select the best attribute to test at that point in the tree. \\nThis forms a greedy search for an acceptable decision tree, in which the algorithm \\nnever backtracks to reconsider earlier choices. A simplified version of the algo- \\nrithm, specialized to learning boolean-valued functions (i.e., concept learning), is \\ndescribed in Table 3.1. \\n3.4.1 Which Attribute Is the Best Classifier? \\nThe central choice in the ID3 algorithm is selecting which attribute to test at \\neach node in the tree. We would like to select the attribute that is most useful \\nfor classifying examples. What is a good quantitative measure of the worth of \\nan attribute? We will define a statistical property, called informution gain, that \\nmeasures how well a given attribute separates the training examples according to \\ntheir target classification. ID3 uses this information gain measure to select among \\nthe candidate attributes at each step while growing the tree. \\n3.4.1.1 ENTROPY MEASURES HOMOGENEITY OF EXAMPLES \\nIn order to define information gain precisely, we begin by defining a measure com- \\nmonly used in information theory, called entropy, that characterizes the (im)purity \\nof an arbitrary collection of examples.

Figure 3.2 shows the form of the entropy function \\nrelative to a boolean classification, as p, varies between 0 and 1. \\nOne interpretation of entropy from information theory is that it specifies the \\nminimum number of bits of information needed to encode the classification of \\nan arbitrary member of S (i.e., a member of S drawn at random with uniform \\nprobability). For example, if p, is 1, the receiver knows the drawn example will \\nbe positive, so no message need be sent, and the entropy is zero. On the other hand, \\nif pe is 0.5, one bit is required to indicate whether the drawn example is positive \\nor negative. If pe is 0.8, then a collection of messages can be encoded using on \\naverage less than 1 bit per message by assigning shorter codes to collections of \\npositive examples and longer codes to less likely negative examples. \\nThus far we have discussed entropy in the special case where the target \\nclassification is boolean.

Therefore, Outlook is selected as the decision attribute for the root node, \\nand branches are created below the root for each of its possible values (i.e., \\nSunny, Overcast, and Rain). The resulting partial decision tree is shown in Fig- \\nure 3.4, along with the training examples sorted to each new descendant node. \\nNote that every example for which Outlook = Overcast is also a positive ex- \\nample of PlayTennis. Therefore, this node of the tree becomes a leaf node with \\nthe classification PlayTennis = Yes. In contrast, the descendants corresponding to \\nOutlook = Sunny and Outlook = Rain still have nonzero entropy, and the decision \\ntree will be further elaborated below these nodes. \\nThe process of selecting a new attribute and partitioning the training exam- \\nples is now repeated for each nontenninal descendant node, this time using only \\nthe training examples associated with that node. Attributes that have been incor- \\nporated higher in the tree are excluded, so that any given attribute can appear at \\nmost once along any path through the tree. This process continues for each new \\nleaf node until either of two conditions is met: (1) every attribute has already been \\nincluded along this path through the tree, or (2) the training examples associated \\nwith this leaf node all have the same target attribute value (i.e., their entropy \\nis zero). Figure 3.4 illustrates the computations of information gain for the next \\nstep in growing the decision tree. The final decision tree learned by ID3 from the \\n14 training examples of Table 3.2 is shown in Figure 3.1. \\n3.5 HYPOTHESIS SPACE SEARCH IN DECISION TREE \\nLEARNING \\nAs with other inductive learning methods, ID3 can be characterized as searching a \\nspace of hypotheses for one that fits the training examples.

In other words, what is its inductive bias? Recall \\nfrom Chapter 2 that inductive bias is the set of assumptions that, together with \\nthe training data, deductively justify the classifications assigned by the learner to \\nfuture instances. \\nGiven a collection of training examples, there are typically many decision \\ntrees consistent with these examples. Describing the inductive bias of ID3 there- \\nfore consists of describing the basis by which it chooses one of these consis- \\ntent hypotheses over the others. Which of these decision trees does ID3 choose? \\nIt chooses the first acceptable tree it encounters in its simple-to-complex, hill- \\nclimbing search through the space of possible trees. Roughly speaking, then, the \\nID3 search strategy (a) selects in favor of shorter trees over longer ones, and \\n(b) selects trees that place the attributes with highest information gain closest to \\nthe root. Because of the subtle interaction between the attribute selection heuris- \\ntic used by ID3 and the particular training examples it encounters, it is difficult \\nto characterize precisely the inductive bias exhibited by ID3. However, we can \\napproximately characterize its bias as a preference for short decision trees over \\ncomplex trees. \\nApproximate inductive bias of ID3: Shorter trees are preferred over larger trees. \\nIn fact, one could imagine an algorithm similar to ID3 that exhibits precisely \\nthis inductive bias. Consider an algorithm that begins with the empty tree and \\nsearches breadth Jirst through progressively more complex trees, first considering \\nall trees of depth 1, then all trees of depth 2, etc. Once it finds a decision tree \\nconsistent with the training data, it returns the smallest consistent tree at that \\nsearch depth (e.g., the tree with the fewest nodes). Let us call this breadth-first \\nsearch algorithm BFS-ID3. BFS-ID3 finds a shortest decision tree and thus exhibits \\nprecisely the bias \"shorter trees are preferred over longer trees.\" ID3 can be \\nviewed as an efficient approximation to BFS-ID3, using a greedy heuristic search \\nto attempt to find the shortest tree without conducting the entire breadth-first \\nsearch through the hypothesis space. \\nBecause ID3 uses the information gain heuristic and a hill climbing strategy, \\nit exhibits a more complex bias than BFS-ID3. In particular, it does not always \\nfind the shortest consistent tree, and it is biased to favor trees that place attributes \\nwith high information gain closest to the root. \\nA closer approximation to the inductive bias of ID3: Shorter trees are preferred \\nover longer trees.

It searches incompletely through this \\nspace, from simple to complex hypotheses, until its termination condition is \\nmet (e.g., until it finds a hypothesis consistent with the data). Its inductive \\nbias is solely a consequence of the ordering of hypotheses by its search \\nstrategy. Its hypothesis space introduces no additional bias. \\n0 The version space CANDIDATE-ELIMINATION algorithm searches an incom- \\nplete hypothesis space (i.e., one that can express only a subset of the poten- \\ntially teachable concepts). It searches this space completely, finding every \\nhypothesis consistent with the training data. Its inductive bias is solely a \\nconsequence of the expressive power of its hypothesis representation. Its \\nsearch strategy introduces no additional bias. \\nIn brief, the inductive bias of ID3 follows from its search strategy, whereas \\nthe inductive bias of the CANDIDATE-ELIMINATION algorithm follows from the def- \\ninition of its search space. \\nThe inductive bias of ID3 is thus a preference for certain hypotheses over \\nothers (e.g., for shorter hypotheses), with no hard restriction on the hypotheses that \\ncan be eventually enumerated. This form of bias is typically called a preference \\nbias (or, alternatively, a search bias). In contrast, the bias of the CANDIDATE- \\nELIMINATION algorithm is in the form of a categorical restriction on the set of \\nhypotheses considered. This form of bias is typically called a restriction bias (or, \\nalternatively, a language bias). \\nGiven that some form of inductive bias is required in order to generalize \\nbeyond the training data (see Chapter 2), which type of inductive bias shall we \\nprefer; a preference bias or restriction bias? \\nTypically, a preference bias is more desirable than a restriction bias, be- \\ncause it allows the learner to work within a complete hypothesis space that is \\nassured to contain the unknown target function. In contrast, a restriction bias that \\nstrictly limits the set of potential hypotheses is generally less desirable, because \\nit introduces the possibility of excluding the unknown target function altogether. \\nWhereas ID3 exhibits a purely preference bias and CANDIDATE-ELIMINATION \\na purely restriction bias, some learning systems combine both. Consider, for ex- \\nample, the program described in Chapter 1 for learning a numerical evaluation \\nfunction for game playing.

Philosophers and others have debated this question \\nfor centuries, and the debate remains unresolved to this day. William of Occam \\nwas one of the first to discusst the question, around the year 1320, so this bias \\noften goes by the name of Occam's razor. \\nOccam's razor: Prefer the simplest hypothesis that fits the data. \\nOf course giving an inductive bias a name does not justify it. Why should one \\nprefer simpler hypotheses? Notice that scientists sometimes appear to follow this \\ninductive bias. Physicists, for example, prefer simple explanations for the motions \\nof the planets, over more complex explanations. Why? One argument is that \\nbecause there are fewer short hypotheses than long ones (based on straightforward \\ncombinatorial arguments), it is less likely that one will find a short hypothesis that \\ncoincidentally fits the training data. In contrast there are often many very complex \\nhypotheses that fit the current training data but fail to generalize correctly to \\nsubsequent data. Consider decision tree hypotheses, for example. There are many \\nmore 500-node decision trees than 5-node decision trees. Given a small set of \\n20 training examples, we might expect to be able to find many 500-node deci- \\nsion trees consistent with these, whereas we would be more surprised if a 5-node \\ndecision tree could perfectly fit this data. We might therefore believe the 5-node \\ntree is less likely to be a statistical coincidence and prefer this hypothesis over \\nthe 500-node hypothesis. \\nUpon closer examination, it turns out there is a major difficulty with the \\nabove argument. By the same reasoning we could have argued that one should \\nprefer decision trees containing exactly 17 leaf nodes with 11 nonleaf nodes, that \\nuse the decision attribute A1 at the root, and test attributes A2 through All, in \\nnumerical order. There are relatively few such trees, and we might argue (by the \\nsame reasoning as above) that our a priori chance of finding one consistent with \\nan arbitrary set of data is therefore small. The difficulty here is that there are very \\nmany small sets of hypotheses that one can define-most of them rather arcane. \\nWhy should we believe that the small set of hypotheses consisting of decision \\ntrees with short descriptions should be any more relevant than the multitude of \\nother small sets of hypotheses that we might define? \\nA second problem with the above argument for Occam's razor is that the size \\nof a hypothesis is determined by the particular representation used internally by \\nthe learner. Two learners using different internal representations could therefore \\nanive at different hypotheses, both justifying their contradictory conclusions by \\nOccam's razor!

On this \\nbasis we might be tempted to reject Occam's razor altogether. However, consider \\nthe following scenario that examines the question of which internal representa- \\ntions might arise from a process of evolution and natural selection. Imagine a \\npopulation of artificial learning agents created by a simulated evolutionary pro- \\ncess involving reproduction, mutation, and natural selection of these agents.

For the sake of argument, let us also assume that \\nthe learning agents employ a fixed learning algorithm (say ID3) that cannot be \\naltered by evolution. It is reasonable to assume that over time evolution will pro- \\nduce internal representation that make these agents increasingly successful within \\ntheir environment. Assuming that the success of an agent depends highly on its \\nability to generalize accurately, we would therefore expect evolution to develop \\ninternal representations that work well with whatever learning algorithm and in- \\nductive bias is present. If the species of agents employs a learning algorithm whose \\ninductive bias is Occam's razor, then we expect evolution to produce internal rep- \\nresentations for which Occam's razor is a successful strategy. The essence of the \\nargument here is that evolution will create internal representations that make the \\nlearning algorithm's inductive bias a self-fulfilling prophecy, simply because it \\ncan alter the representation easier than it can alter the learning algorithm. \\nFor now, we leave the debate regarding Occam's razor. We will revisit it in \\nChapter 6, where we discuss the Minimum Description Length principle, a version \\nof Occam's razor that can be interpreted within a Bayesian framework. \\n3.7 ISSUES IN DECISION TREE LEARNING \\nPractical issues in learning decision trees include determining how deeply to grow \\nthe decision tree, handling continuous attributes, choosing an appropriate attribute \\nselection measure, andling training data with missing attribute values, handling \\nattributes with differing costs, and improving computational efficiency.

(199.5). \\nThe first of the above approaches is the most common and is often referred \\nto as a training and validation set approach. We discuss the two main variants of \\nthis approach below. In this approach, the available data are separated into two \\nsets of examples: a training set, which is used to form the learned hypothesis, and \\na separate validation set, which is used to evaluate the accuracy of this hypothesis \\nover subsequent data and, in particular, to evaluate the impact of pruning this \\nhypothesis. The motivation is this: Even though the learner may be misled by \\nrandom errors and coincidental regularities within the training set, the validation \\nset is unlikely to exhibit the same random fluctuations. Therefore, the validation \\nset can be expected to provide a safety check against overfitting the spurious \\ncharacteristics of the training set.

Nodes are pruned \\niteratively, always choosing the node whose removal most increases the decision \\ntree accuracy over the validation set. Pruning of nodes continues until further \\npruning is harmful (i.e., decreases accuracy of the tree over the validation set). \\nThe impact of reduced-error pruning on the accuracy of the decision tree \\nis illustrated in Figure 3.7. As in Figure 3.6, the accuracy of the tree is shown \\nmeasured over both training examples and test examples. The additional line in \\nFigure 3.7 shows accuracy over the test examples as the tree is pruned. When \\npruning begins, the tree is at its maximum size and lowest accuracy over the test \\nset. As pruning proceeds, the number of nodes is reduced and accuracy over the \\ntest set increases. Here, the available data has been split into three subsets: the \\ntraining examples, the validation examples used for pruning the tree, and a set of \\ntest examples used to provide an unbiased estimate of accuracy over future unseen \\nexamples. The plot shows accuracy over the training and test sets.

(1995). \\n3.7.1.2 RULE POST-PRUNING \\nIn practice, one quite successful method for finding high accuracy hypotheses is \\na technique we shall call rule post-pruning. A variant of this pruning method is \\nused by C4.5 (Quinlan 1993), which is an outgrowth of the original ID3 algorithm. \\nRule post-pruning involves the following steps: \\n1. Infer the decision tree from the training set, growing the tree until the training \\ndata is fit as well as possible and allowing overfitting to occur. \\n2. Convert the learned tree into an equivalent set of rules by creating one rule \\nfor each path from the root node to a leaf node. \\n3. Prune (generalize) each rule by removing any preconditions that result in \\nimproving its estimated accuracy. \\n4. Sort the pruned rules by their estimated accuracy, and consider them in this \\nsequence when classifying subsequent instances. \\nTo illustrate, consider again the decision tree in Figure 3.1. In rule post- \\npruning, one rule is generated for each leaf node in the tree. Each attribute test \\nalong the path from the root to the leaf becomes a rule antecedent (precondition) \\nand the classification at the leaf node becomes the rule consequent (postcondition). \\nFor example, the leftmost path of the tree in Figure 3.1 is translated into the rule \\nIF (Outlook = Sunny) A (Humidity = High) \\nTHEN PlayTennis = No \\nNext, each such rule is pruned by removing any antecedent, or precondi- \\ntion, whose removal does not worsen its estimated accuracy. Given the above \\nrule, for example, rule post-pruning would consider removing the preconditions \\n(Outlook = Sunny) and (Humidity = High). It would select whichever of these \\npruning steps produced the greatest improvement in estimated rule accuracy, then \\nconsider pruning the second precondition as a further pruning step. No pruning \\nstep is performed if it reduces the estimated rule accuracy. \\nAs noted above, one method to estimate rule accuracy is to use a validation \\nset of examples disjoint from the training set. Another method, used by C4.5, \\nis to evaluate performance based on the training set itself, using a pessimistic \\nestimate to make up for the fact that the training data gives an estimate biased \\nin favor of the rules. More precisely, C4.5 calculates its pessimistic estimate by \\ncalculating the rule accuracy over the training examples to which it applies, then \\ncalculating the standard deviation in this estimated accuracy assuming a binomial \\ndistribution. For a given confidence level, the lower-bound estimate is then taken \\nas the measure of rule performance (e.g., for a 95% confidence interval, rule \\naccuracy is pessimistically estimated by the observed accuracy over the training'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'macOS Version 11.2.3 (Build 20D91) Quartz PDFContext', 'creator': 'Preview', 'creationdate': \"D:20210312135113Z00'00'\", 'title': 'Machine - Learning - Tom Mitchell.pdf', 'moddate': \"D:20210312135113Z00'00'\", 'source': '..\\\\Data\\\\PDFiles\\\\MachineLearningTomMitchell.pdf', 'total_pages': 421, 'page': 83, 'page_label': '84'}, page_content='set, minus 1.96 times the estimated standard deviation). The net effect is that for \\nlarge data sets, the pessimistic estimate is very close to the observed accuracy \\n(e.g., the standard deviation is very small), whereas it grows further from the \\nobserved accuracy as the size of the data set decreases. Although this heuristic \\nmethod is not statistically valid, it has nevertheless been found useful in practice. \\nSee Chapter 5 for a discussion of statistically valid approaches to estimating means \\nand confidence intervals. \\nWhy convert the decision tree to rules before pruning? There are three main \\nadvantages. \\nConverting to rules allows distinguishing among the different contexts in \\nwhich a decision node is used. Because each distinct path through the deci- \\nsion tree node produces a distinct rule, the pruning decision regarding that \\nattribute test can be made differently for each path. In contrast, if the tree \\nitself were pruned, the only two choices would be to remove the decision \\nnode completely, or to retain it in its original form. \\nConverting to rules removes the distinction between attribute tests that occur \\nnear the root of the tree and those that occur near the leaves. Thus, we avoid \\nmessy bookkeeping issues such as how to reorganize the tree if the root node \\nis pruned while retaining part of the subtree below this test. \\nConverting to rules improves readability. Rules are often easier for \\nto understand. \\n3.7.2 Incorporating Continuous-Valued Attributes \\nOur initial definition of ID3 is restricted to attributes that take on a discrete set \\nof values. First, the target attribute whose value is predicted by the learned tree \\nmust be discrete valued. Second, the attributes tested in the decision nodes of \\nthe tree must also be discrete valued. This second restriction can easily be re- \\nmoved so that continuous-valued decision attributes can be incorporated into the \\nlearned tree. This can be accomplished by dynamically defining new discrete- \\nvalued attributes that partition the continuous attribute value into a discrete set \\nof intervals. In particular, for an attribute A that is continuous-valued, the algo- \\nrithm can dynamically create a new boolean attribute A, that is true if A < c \\nand false otherwise. The only question is how to select the best value for the \\nthreshold c. \\nAs an example, suppose we wish to include the continuous-valued attribute \\nTemperature in describing the training example days in the learning task of Ta- \\nble 3.2. Suppose further that the training examples associated with a particular \\nnode in the decision tree have the following values for Temperature and the target \\nattribute PlayTennis. \\nTemperature: 40 48 60 72 80 90 \\nPlayTennis: No No Yes Yes Yes NO'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'macOS Version 11.2.3 (Build 20D91) Quartz PDFContext', 'creator': 'Preview', 'creationdate': \"D:20210312135113Z00'00'\", 'title': 'Machine - Learning - Tom Mitchell.pdf', 'moddate': \"D:20210312135113Z00'00'\", 'source': '..\\\\Data\\\\PDFiles\\\\MachineLearningTomMitchell.pdf', 'total_pages': 421, 'page': 84, 'page_label': '85'}, page_content='CHAPTER 3 DECISION TREE LEARNING 73 \\nWhat threshold-based boolean attribute should be defined based on Temper- \\nature? Clearly, we would like to pick a threshold, c, that produces the greatest \\ninformation gain. By sorting the examples according to the continuous attribute \\nA, then identifying adjacent examples that differ in their target classification, we \\ncan generate a set of candidate thresholds midway between the corresponding \\nvalues of A. It can be shown that the value of c that maximizes information gain \\nmust always lie at such a boundary (Fayyad 1991). These candidate thresholds \\ncan then be evaluated by computing the information gain associated with each. \\nIn the current example, there are two candidate thresholds, corresponding to the \\nvalues of Temperature at which the value of PlayTennis changes: (48 + 60)/2, \\nand (80 + 90)/2. The information gain can then be computed for each of the \\ncandidate attributes, Temperat~re,~~ and Temperat~re,~~, and the best can be \\nselected (Temperat~re,~~). This dynamically created boolean attribute can then \\ncompete with the other discrete-valued candidate attributes available for growing \\nthe decision tree. Fayyad and Irani (1993) discuss an extension to this approach \\nthat splits the continuous attribute into multiple intervals rather than just two in- \\ntervals based on a single threshold. Utgoff and Brodley (1991) and Murthy et al. \\n( 1994) discuss approaches that define features by thresholding linear combinations \\nof several continuous-valued attributes. \\n3.7.3 Alternative Measures for Selecting Attributes \\nThere is a natural bias in the information gain measure that favors attributes with \\nmany values over those with few values. As an extreme example, consider the \\nattribute Date, which has a very large number of possible values (e.g., March 4, \\n1979). If we were to add this attribute to the data in Table 3.2, it would have \\nthe highest information gain of any of the attributes. This is because Date alone \\nperfectly predicts the target attribute over the training data. Thus, it would be \\nselected as the decision attribute for the root node of the tree and lead to a (quite \\nbroad) tree of depth one, which perfectly classifies the training data. Of course, \\nthis decision tree would fare poorly on subsequent examples, because it is not a \\nuseful predictor despite the fact that it perfectly separates the training data. \\nWhat is wrong with the attribute Date? Simply put, it has so many possible \\nvalues that it is bound to separate the training examples into very small subsets. \\nBecause of this, it will have a very high information gain relative to the training \\nexamples, despite being a very poor predictor of the target function over unseen \\ninstances. \\nOne way to avoid this difficulty is to select decision attributes based on some \\nmeasure other than information gain. One alternative measure that has been used \\nsuccessfully is the gain ratio (Quinlan 1986). The gain ratio measure penalizes \\nattributes such as Date by incorporating a term, called split informution, that is \\nsensitive to how broadly and uniformly the attribute splits the data:'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'macOS Version 11.2.3 (Build 20D91) Quartz PDFContext', 'creator': 'Preview', 'creationdate': \"D:20210312135113Z00'00'\", 'title': 'Machine - Learning - Tom Mitchell.pdf', 'moddate': \"D:20210312135113Z00'00'\", 'source': '..\\\\Data\\\\PDFiles\\\\MachineLearningTomMitchell.pdf', 'total_pages': 421, 'page': 85, 'page_label': '86'}, page_content=\"74 MACHINE LEARNING \\nwhere S1 through S, are the c subsets of examples resulting from partitioning S \\nby the c-valued attribute A. Note that Splitlnfomzation is actually the entropy of \\nS with respect to the values of attribute A. This is in contrast to our previous \\nuses of entropy, in which we considered only the entropy of S with respect to the \\ntarget attribute whose value is to be predicted by the learned tree. \\nThe Gain Ratio measure is defined in terms of the earlier Gain measure, as \\nwell as this Splitlnfomzation, as follows \\nGain (S, A) \\nGainRatio(S, A) r \\nSplit Inf ormation(S, A) \\nNotice that the Splitlnfomzation term discourages the selection of attributes with \\nmany uniformly distributed values. For example, consider a collection of n ex- \\namples that are completely separated by attribute A (e.g., Date). In this case, the \\nSplitlnfomzation value will be log, n. In contrast, a boolean attribute B that splits \\nthe same n examples exactly in half will have Splitlnfomzation of 1. If attributes \\nA and B produce the same information gain, then clearly B will score higher \\naccording to the Gain Ratio measure. \\nOne practical issue that arises in using GainRatio in place of Gain to \\nselect attributes is that the denominator can be zero or very small when ISi 1 x IS1 \\nfor one of the Si. This either makes the GainRatio undefined or very large for \\nattributes that happen to have the same value for nearly all members of S. To \\navoid selecting attributes purely on this basis, we can adopt some heuristic such \\nas first calculating the Gain of each attribute, then applying the GainRatio test \\nonly considering those attributes with above average Gain (Quinlan 1986). \\nAn alternative to the GainRatio, designed to directly address the above \\ndifficulty, is a distance-based measure introduced by Lopez de Mantaras (1991). \\nThis measure is based on defining a distance metric between partitions of'the \\ndata. Each attribute is evaluated based on the distance between the data partition \\nit creates and the perfect partition (i.e., the partition that perfectly classifies the \\ntraining data). The attribute whose partition is closest to the perfect partition is \\nchosen. Lopez de Mantaras (1991) defines this distance measure, proves that it \\nis not biased toward attributes with large numbers of values, and reports experi- \\nmental studies indicating that the predictive accuracy of the induced trees is not \\nsignificantly different from that obtained with the Gain and Gain Ratio measures. \\nHowever, this distance measure avoids the practical difficulties associated with the \\nGainRatio measure, and in his experiments it produces significantly smaller trees \\nin the case of data sets whose attributes have very different numbers of values. \\nA variety of other selection measures have been proposed as well (e.g., \\nsee Breiman et al. 1984; Mingers 1989a; Kearns and Mansour 1996; Dietterich \\net al. 1996). Mingers (1989a) provides an experimental analysis of the relative \\neffectiveness of several selection measures over a variety of problems. He reports \\nsignificant differences in the sizes of the unpruned trees produced by the different \\nselection measures. However, in his experimental domains the choice of attribute \\nselection measure appears to have a smaller impact on final accuracy than does \\nthe extent and method of post-pruning.\"), Document(metadata={'producer': 'macOS Version 11.2.3 (Build 20D91) Quartz PDFContext', 'creator': 'Preview', 'creationdate': \"D:20210312135113Z00'00'\", 'title': 'Machine - Learning - Tom Mitchell.pdf', 'moddate': \"D:20210312135113Z00'00'\", 'source': '..\\\\Data\\\\PDFiles\\\\MachineLearningTomMitchell.pdf', 'total_pages': 421, 'page': 86, 'page_label': '87'}, page_content='CHAPTER 3 DECISION TREE LEARNING 75 \\n3.7.4 Handling Training Examples with Missing Attribute Values \\nIn certain cases, the available data may be missing values for some attributes. \\nFor example, in a medical domain in which we wish to predict patient outcome \\nbased on various laboratory tests, it may be that the lab test Blood-Test-Result is \\navailable only for a subset of the patients. In such cases, it is common to estimate \\nthe missing attribute value based on other examples for which this attribute has a \\nknown value. \\nConsider the situation in which Gain(S, A) is to be calculated at node n in \\nthe decision tree to evaluate whether the attribute A is the best attribute to test \\nat this decision node. Suppose that (x, c(x)) is one of the training examples in S \\nand that the value A(x) is unknown. \\nOne strategy for dealing with the missing attribute value is to assign it the \\nvalue that is most common among training examples at node n. Alternatively, we \\nmight assign it the most common value among examples at node n that have the \\nclassification c(x). The elaborated training example using this estimated value for \\nA(x) can then be used directly by the existing decision tree learning algorithm. \\nThis strategy is examined by Mingers (1989a). \\nA second, more complex procedure is to assign a probability to each of the \\npossible values of A rather than simply assigning the most common value to A(x). \\nThese probabilities can be estimated again based on the observed frequencies of \\nthe various values for A among the examples at node n. For example, given a \\nboolean attribute A, if node n contains six known examples with A = 1 and four \\nwith A = 0, then we would say the probability that A(x) = 1 is 0.6, and the \\nprobability that A(x) = 0 is 0.4. A fractional 0.6 of instance x is now distributed \\ndown the branch for A = 1, and a fractional 0.4 of x down the other tree branch. \\nThese fractional examples are used for the purpose of computing information \\nGain and can be further subdivided at subsequent branches of the tree if a second \\nmissing attribute value must be tested. This same fractioning of examples can \\nalso be applied after learning, to classify new instances whose attribute values \\nare unknown. In this case, the classification of the new instance is simply the \\nmost probable classification, computed by summing the weights of the instance \\nfragments classified in different ways at the leaf nodes of the tree. This method \\nfor handling missing attribute values is used in C4.5 (Quinlan 1993). \\n3.7.5 Handling Attributes with Differing Costs \\nIn some learning tasks the instance attributes may have associated costs. For \\nexample, in learning to classify medical diseases we might describe patients in \\nterms of attributes such as Temperature, BiopsyResult, Pulse, BloodTestResults, \\netc. These attributes vary significantly in their costs, both in terms of monetary \\ncost and cost to patient comfort. In such tasks, we would prefer decision trees that \\nuse low-cost attributes where possible, relying on high-cost attributes only when \\nneeded to produce reliable classifications. \\nID3 can be modified to take into account attribute costs by introducing a cost \\nterm into the attribute selection measure.

While \\nsuch cost-sensitive measures do not guarantee finding an optimal cost-sensitive \\ndecision tree, they do bias the search in favor of low-cost attributes. \\nTan and Schlimmer (1990) and Tan (1993) describe one such approach and \\napply it to a robot perception task in which the robot must learn to classify dif- \\nferent objects according to how they can be grasped by the robot's manipulator. \\nIn this case the attributes correspond to different sensor readings obtained by a \\nmovable sonar on the robot.

The ID3 family of algorithms \\ninfers decision trees by growing them from the root downward, greedily \\nselecting the next best attribute for each new decision branch added to the \\ntree. \\nID3 searches a complete hypothesis space (i.e., the space of decision trees \\ncan represent any discrete-valued function defined over discrete-valued in- \\nstances). It thereby avoids the major difficulty associated with approaches \\nthat consider only restricted sets of hypotheses: that the target function might \\nnot be present in the hypothesis space. \\nThe inductive bias implicit in ID3 includes a preference for smaller trees; \\nthat is, its search through the hypothesis space grows the tree only as large \\nas needed in order to classify the available training examples. \\nOverfitting the training data is an important issue in decision tree learning. \\nBecause the training examples are only a sample of all possible instances,\"), Document(metadata={'producer': 'macOS Version 11.2.3 (Build 20D91) Quartz PDFContext', 'creator': 'Preview', 'creationdate': \"D:20210312135113Z00'00'\", 'title': 'Machine - Learning - Tom Mitchell.pdf', 'moddate': \"D:20210312135113Z00'00'\", 'source': '..\\\\Data\\\\PDFiles\\\\MachineLearningTomMitchell.pdf', 'total_pages': 421, 'page': 88, 'page_label': '89'}, page_content=\"CHAFER 3 DECISION TREE LEARNING 77 \\nit is possible to add branches to the tree that improve performance on the \\ntraining examples while decreasing performance on other instances outside \\nthis set. Methods for post-pruning the decision tree are therefore important \\nto avoid overfitting in decision tree learning (and other inductive inference \\nmethods that employ a preference bias). \\nA large variety of extensions to the basic ID3 algorithm has been developed \\nby different researchers. These include methods for post-pruning trees, han- \\ndling real-valued attributes, accommodating training examples with miss- \\ning attribute values, incrementally refining decision trees as new training \\nexamples become available, using attribute selection measures other than \\ninformation gain, and considering costs associated with instance attributes. \\nAmong the earliest work on decision tree learning is Hunt's Concept Learn- \\ning System (CLS) (Hunt et al. 1966) and Friedman and Breiman's work resulting \\nin the CART system (Friedman 1977; Breiman et al. 1984).

In rough analogy, artificial neural networks are built out \\nof a densely interconnected set of simple units, where each unit takes a number \\nof real-valued inputs (possibly the outputs of other units) and produces a single \\nreal-valued output (which may become the input to many other units). \\nTo develop a feel for this analogy, let us consider a few facts from neuro- \\nbiology. The human brain, for example, is estimated to contain a densely inter- \\nconnected network of approximately 1011 neurons, each connected, on average, to \\nlo4 others. Neuron activity is typically excited or inhibited through connections to \\nother neurons. The fastest neuron switching times are known to be on the order of \\nloe3 seconds--quite slow compared to computer switching speeds of 10-lo sec- \\nonds. Yet humans are able to make surprisingly complex decisions, surprisingly \\nquickly. For example, it requires approximately lo-' seconds to visually recognize \\nyour mother. Notice the sequence of neuron firings that can take place during this \\n10-'-second interval cannot possibly be longer than a few hundred steps, given \\nthe switching speed of single neurons. This observation has led many to speculate \\nthat the information-processing abilities of biological neural systems must follow \\nfrom highly parallel processes operating on representations that are distributed \\nover many neurons. One motivation for ANN systems is to capture this kind \\nof highly parallel computation based on distributed representations. Most ANN \\nsoftware runs on sequential machines emulating distributed processes, although \\nfaster versions of the algorithms have also been implemented on highly parallel \\nmachines and on specialized hardware designed specifically for ANN applications. \\nWhile ANNs are loosely motivated by biological neural systems, there are \\nmany complexities to biological neural systems that are not modeled by ANNs, \\nand many features of the ANNs we discuss here are known to be inconsistent \\nwith biological systems. For example, we consider here ANNs whose individual \\nunits output a single constant value, whereas biological neurons output a complex \\ntime series of spikes. \\nHistorically, two groups of researchers have worked with artificial neural \\nnetworks. One group has been motivated by the goal of using ANNs to study \\nand model biological learning processes. A second group has been motivated by \\nthe goal of obtaining highly effective machine learning algorithms, independent of \\nwhether these algorithms mirror biological processes. Within this book our interest \\nfits the latter group, and therefore we will not dwell further on biological modeling. \\nFor more information on attempts to model biological systems using ANNs, see, \\nfor example, Churchland and Sejnowski (1992); Zornetzer et al. (1994); Gabriel \\nand Moore (1990). \\n4.2 NEURAL NETWORK REPRESENTATIONS \\nA prototypical example of ANN learning is provided by Pomerleau's (1993) sys- \\ntem ALVINN, which uses a learned ANN to steer an autonomous vehicle driving\"), Document(metadata={'producer': 'macOS Version 11.2.3 (Build 20D91) Quartz PDFContext', 'creator': 'Preview', 'creationdate': \"D:20210312135113Z00'00'\", 'title': 'Machine - Learning - Tom Mitchell.pdf', 'moddate': \"D:20210312135113Z00'00'\", 'source': '..\\\\Data\\\\PDFiles\\\\MachineLearningTomMitchell.pdf', 'total_pages': 421, 'page': 94, 'page_label': '95'}, page_content='at normal speeds on public highways. The input to the neural network is a 30 x 32 \\ngrid of pixel intensities obtained from a forward-pointed camera mounted on the \\nvehicle. The network output is the direction in which the vehicle is steered. The \\nANN is trained to mimic the observed steering commands of a human driving the \\nvehicle for approximately 5 minutes. ALVINN has used its learned networks to \\nsuccessfully drive at speeds up to 70 miles per hour and for distances of 90 miles \\non public highways (driving in the left lane of a divided public highway, with \\nother vehicles present). \\nFigure 4.1 illustrates the neural network representation used in one version \\nof the ALVINN system, and illustrates the kind of representation typical of many \\nANN systems. The network is shown on the left side of the figure, with the input \\ncamera image depicted below it. Each node (i.e., circle) in the network diagram \\ncorresponds to the output of a single network unit, and the lines entering the node \\nfrom below are its inputs. As can be seen, there are four units that receive inputs \\ndirectly from all of the 30 x 32 pixels in the image. These are called \"hidden\" \\nunits because their output is available only within the network and is not available \\nas part of the global network output. Each of these four hidden units computes a \\nsingle real-valued output based on a weighted combination of its 960 inputs. These \\nhidden unit outputs are then used as inputs to a second layer of 30 \"output\" units. \\nEach output unit corresponds to a particular steering direction, and the output \\nvalues of these units determine which steering direction is recommended most \\nstrongly. \\nThe diagrams on the right side of the figure depict the learned weight values \\nassociated with one of the four hidden units in this ANN. The large matrix of \\nblack and white boxes on the lower right depicts the weights from the 30 x 32 pixel \\ninputs into the hidden unit. Here, a white box indicates a positive weight, a black \\nbox a negative weight, and the size of the box indicates the weight magnitude. \\nThe smaller rectangular diagram directly above the large matrix shows the weights \\nfrom this hidden unit to each of the 30 output units. \\nThe network structure of ALYINN is typical of many ANNs. Here the in- \\ndividual units are interconnected in layers that form a directed acyclic graph. In \\ngeneral, ANNs can be graphs with many types of structures-acyclic or cyclic, \\ndirected or undirected. This chapter will focus on the most common and practical \\nANN approaches, which are based on the BACKPROPAGATION algorithm. The BACK- \\nPROPAGATION algorithm assumes the network is a fixed structure that corresponds \\nto a directed graph, possibly containing cycles. Learning corresponds to choosing \\na weight value for each edge in the graph. Although certain types of cycles are \\nallowed, the vast majority of practical applications involve acyclic feed-forward \\nnetworks, similar to the network structure used by ALVINN. \\n4.3 APPROPRIATE PROBLEMS FOR NEURAL NETWORK \\nLEARNING \\nANN learning is well-suited to problems in which the training data corresponds \\nto noisy, complex sensor data, such as inputs from cameras and microphones.'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'macOS Version 11.2.3 (Build 20D91) Quartz PDFContext', 'creator': 'Preview', 'creationdate': \"D:20210312135113Z00'00'\", 'title': 'Machine - Learning - Tom Mitchell.pdf', 'moddate': \"D:20210312135113Z00'00'\", 'source': '..\\\\Data\\\\PDFiles\\\\MachineLearningTomMitchell.pdf', 'total_pages': 421, 'page': 95, 'page_label': '96'}, page_content=\"E2' Straight \\nAhead \\n1 1 1 30 Output \\nUnits \\nn \\n30x32 Sensor \\nInput Retina \\n1 \\nFIGURE 4.1 \\nNeural network learning to steer an autonomous vehicle.

In \\nthese cases ANN and decision tree learning often produce results of comparable \\naccuracy. See Shavlik et al. (1991) and Weiss and Kapouleas (1989) for exper- \\nimental comparisons of decision tree and ANN learning. The BACKPROPAGATION \\nalgorithm is the most commonly used ANN learning technique. It is appropriate \\nfor problems with the following characteristics: \\n0 Instances are represented by many attribute-value pairs. The target function \\nto be learned is defined over instances that can be described by a vector of \\npredefined features, such as the pixel values in the ALVINN example. These \\ninput attributes may be highly correlated or independent of one another. \\nInput values can be any real values. \\nThe target function output may be discrete-valued, real-valued, or a vector \\nof several real- or discrete-valued attributes. For example, in the ALVINN \\nsystem the output is a vector of 30 attributes, each corresponding to a rec- \\nommendation regarding the steering direction. The value of each output is \\nsome real number between 0 and 1, which in this case corresponds to the \\nconfidence in predicting the corresponding steering direction. We can also \\ntrain a single network to output both the steering command and suggested \\nacceleration, simply by concatenating the vectors that encode these two out- \\nput predictions. \\nThe training examples may contain errors. ANN learning methods are quite \\nrobust to noise in the training data. \\nLong training times are acceptable. Network training algorithms typically \\nrequire longer training times than, say, decision tree learning algorithms. \\nTraining times can range from a few seconds to many hours, depending \\non factors such as the number of weights in the network, the number of \\ntraining examples considered, and the settings of various learning algorithm \\nparameters. \\nFast evaluation of the learned target function may be required. Although \\nANN learning times are relatively long, evaluating the learned network, in \\norder to apply it to a subsequent instance, is typically very fast. For example, \\nALVINN applies its neural network several times per second to continually \\nupdate its steering command as the vehicle drives forward. \\nI \\nThe ability of humans to understand the learned target function is not impor- \\ntant. The weights learned by neural networks are often difficult for humans to \\ninterpret. Learned neural networks are less easily communicated to humans \\nthan learned rules. \\nThe rest of this chapter is organized as follows: We first consider several \\nalternative designs for the primitive units that make up artificial neural networks \\n(perce~trons, linear units, and sigmoid units), along with learning algorithms for \\ntraining single units.

A perceptron takes a vector of real-valued inputs, calculates a linear \\ncombination of these inputs, then outputs a 1 if the result is greater than some \\nthreshold and -1 otherwise. More precisely, given inputs xl through x,, the output \\no(x1, . . . , x,) computed by the perceptron is \\no(x1,. ..,x,) = 1 if wo + wlxl+ ~2x2 + - . + W,X, > 0 \\n-1 otherwise \\nwhere each wi is a real-valued constant, or weight, that determines the contribution \\nof input xi to the perceptron output. Notice the quantity (-wO) is a threshold that \\nthe weighted combination of inputs wlxl + . . . + wnxn must surpass in order for \\nthe perceptron to output a 1. \\nTo simplify notation, we imagine an additional constant input xo = 1, al- \\nlowing us to write the above inequality as C:=o wixi > 0, or in vector form as \\niir ..i! > 0. For brevity, we will sometimes write the perceptron function as \\nwhere \\nLearning a perceptron involves choosing values for the weights wo, . . . , w,. \\nTherefore, the space H of candidate hypotheses considered in perceptron learning \\nis the set of all possible real-valued weight vectors. \\n4.4.1 Representational Power of Perceptrons \\nWe can view the perceptron as representing a hyperplane decision surface in the \\nn-dimensional space of instances (i.e., points). The perceptron outputs a 1 for \\ninstances lying on one side of the hyperplane and outputs a -1 for instances \\nlying on the other side, as illustrated in Figure 4.3. The equation for this decision \\nhyperplane is iir . .i! = 0. Of course, some sets of positive and negative examples \\ncannot be separated by any hyperplane.

For \\nexample, if we assume boolean values of 1 (true) and -1 (false), then one way to \\nuse a two-input perceptron to implement the AND function is to set the weights \\nwo = -3, and wl = wz = .5. This perceptron can be made to represent the OR \\nfunction instead by altering the threshold to wo = -.3. In fact, AND and OR can \\nbe viewed as special cases of m-of-n functions: that is, functions where at least \\nm of the n inputs to the perceptron must be true. The OR function corresponds to \\nrn = 1 and the AND function to m = n. Any m-of-n function is easily represented \\nusing a perceptron by setting all input weights to the same value (e.g., 0.5) and \\nthen setting the threshold wo accordingly. \\nPerceptrons can represent all of the primitive boolean functions AND, OR, \\nNAND (1 AND), and NOR (1 OR).

Here \\nthe precise learning problem is to determine a weight vector that causes the per- \\nceptron to produce the correct f 1 output for each of the given training examples. \\nSeveral algorithms are known to solve this learning problem. Here we con- \\nsider two: the perceptron rule and the delta rule (a variant of the LMS rule used \\nin Chapter 1 for learning evaluation functions). These two algorithms are guaran- \\nteed to converge to somewhat different acceptable hypotheses, under somewhat \\ndifferent conditions. They are important to ANNs because they provide the basis \\nfor learning networks of many units. \\nOne way to learn an acceptable weight vector is to begin with random \\nweights, then iteratively apply the perceptron to each training example, modify- \\ning the perceptron weights whenever it misclassifies an example. This process is \\nrepeated, iterating through the training examples as many times as needed until \\nthe perceptron classifies all training examples correctly. Weights are modified at \\neach step according to the perceptron training rule, which revises the weight wi \\nassociated with input xi according to the rule \\nwhere \\nHere t is the target output for the current training example, o is the output generated \\nby the perceptron, and q is a positive constant called the learning rate. The role \\nof the learning rate is to moderate the degree to which weights are changed at \\neach step. It is usually set to some small value (e.g., 0.1) and is sometimes made \\nto decay as the number of weight-tuning iterations increases. \\nWhy should this update rule converge toward successful weight values? To \\nget an intuitive feel, consider some specific cases. Suppose the training example is \\ncorrectly classified already by the perceptron. In this case, (t - o) is zero, making \\nAwi zero, so that no weights are updated. Suppose the perceptron outputs a -1, \\nwhen the target output is + 1. To make the perceptron output a + 1 instead of - 1 in \\nthis case, the weights must be altered to increase the value of G.2. For example, if \\nxi r 0, then increasing wi will bring the perceptron closer to correctly classifying'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'macOS Version 11.2.3 (Build 20D91) Quartz PDFContext', 'creator': 'Preview', 'creationdate': \"D:20210312135113Z00'00'\", 'title': 'Machine - Learning - Tom Mitchell.pdf', 'moddate': \"D:20210312135113Z00'00'\", 'source': '..\\\\Data\\\\PDFiles\\\\MachineLearningTomMitchell.pdf', 'total_pages': 421, 'page': 100, 'page_label': '101'}, page_content='this example. Notice the training rule will increase w, in this case, because (t - o), \\n7, and Xi are all positive. For example, if xi = .8, q = 0.1, t = 1, and o = - 1, \\nthen the weight update will be Awi = q(t - o)xi = O.1(1 - (-1))0.8 = 0.16. On \\nthe other hand, if t = -1 and o = 1, then weights associated with positive xi will \\nbe decreased rather than increased. \\nIn fact, the above learning procedure can be proven to converge within a \\nfinite number of applications of the perceptron training rule to a weight vec- \\ntor that correctly classifies all training examples, provided the training examples \\nare linearly separable and provided a sufficiently small 7 is used (see Minsky \\nand Papert 1969). If the data are not linearly separable, convergence is not as- \\nsured. \\n4.4.3 Gradient Descent and the Delta Rule \\nAlthough the perceptron rule finds a successful weight vector when the training \\nexamples are linearly separable, it can fail to converge if the examples are not \\nlinearly separable. A second training rule, called the delta rule, is designed to \\novercome this difficulty. If the training examples are not linearly separable, the \\ndelta rule converges toward a best-fit approximation to the target concept. \\nThe key idea behind the delta rule is to use gradient descent to search the hy- \\npothesis space of possible weight vectors to find the weights that best fit the train- \\ning examples. This rule is important because gradient descent provides the basis \\nfor the BACKPROPAGATION algorithm, which can learn networks with many inter- \\nconnected units. It is also important because gradient descent can serve as the \\nbasis for learning algorithms that must search through hypothesis spaces contain- \\ning many different types of continuously parameterized hypotheses. \\nThe delta training rule is best understood by considering the task of training \\nan unthresholded perceptron; that is, a linear unit for which the output o is given by \\nThus, a linear unit corresponds to the first stage of a perceptron, without the \\nthreshold. \\nIn order to derive a weight learning rule for linear units, let us begin by \\nspecifying a measure for the training error of a hypothesis (weight vector), relative \\nto the training examples. Although there are many ways to define this error, one \\ncommon measure that will turn out to be especially convenient is \\nwhere D is the set of training examples, td is the target output for training example \\nd, and od is the output of the linear unit for training example d.

The key differences between \\nstandard gradient descent and stochastic gradient descent are: \\n0 In standard gradient descent, the error is summed over all examples before \\nupdating weights, whereas in stochastic gradient descent weights are updated \\nupon examining each training example. \\n. Summing over multiple examples in standard gradient descent requires more \\ncomputation per weight update step.

The perceptron training rule converges after a finite number \\nof iterations to a hypothesis that perfectly classifies the training data, provided the \\ntraining examples are linearly separable. The delta rule converges only asymp- \\ntotically toward the minimum error hypothesis, possibly requiring unbounded \\ntime, but converges regardless of whether the training data are linearly sepa- \\nrable. A detailed presentation of the convergence proofs can be found in Hertz et \\nal. (1991). \\nA third possible algorithm for learning the weight vector is linear program- \\nming. Linear programming is a general, efficient method for solving sets of linear \\ninequalities. Notice each training example corresponds to an inequality of the \\nform zZI - x\\' > 0 or G . x\\' 5 0, and their solution is the desired weight vector. Un- \\nfortunately, this approach yields a solution only when the training examples are \\nlinearly separable; however, Duda and Hart (1973, p. 168) suggest a more subtle \\nformulation that accommodates the nonseparable case. In any case, the approach \\nof linear programming does not scale to training multilayer networks, which is \\nour primary concern. In contrast, the gradient descent approach, on which the \\ndelta rule is based, can be easily extended to multilayer networks, as shown in \\nthe following section. \\n4.5 MULTILAYER NETWORKS AND THE BACKPROPAGATION \\nALGORITHM \\nAs noted in Section 4.4.1, single perceptrons can only express linear decision \\nsurfaces. In contrast, the kind of multilayer networks learned by the BACKPROPA- \\nCATION algorithm are capable of expressing a rich variety of nonlinear decision \\nsurfaces.

Here the speech recognition task involves distinguishing \\namong 10 possible vowels, all spoken in the context of \"h-d\" (i.e., \"hid,\" \"had,\" \\n\"head,\" \"hood,\" etc.). The input speech signal is represented by two numerical \\nparameters obtained from a spectral analysis of the sound, allowing us to easily \\nvisualize the decision surface over the two-dimensional instance space. As shown \\nin the figure, it is possible for the multilayer network to represent highly nonlinear \\ndecision surfaces that are much more expressive than the linear decision surfaces \\nof single units shown earlier in Figure 4.3. \\nThis section discusses how to learn such multilayer networks using a gradient \\ndescent algorithm similar to that discussed in the previous section. \\n4.5.1 A Differentiable Threshold Unit \\nWhat type of unit shall we use as the basis for constructing multilayer networks? \\nAt first we might be tempted to choose the linear units discussed in the previous'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'macOS Version 11.2.3 (Build 20D91) Quartz PDFContext', 'creator': 'Preview', 'creationdate': \"D:20210312135113Z00'00'\", 'title': 'Machine - Learning - Tom Mitchell.pdf', 'moddate': \"D:20210312135113Z00'00'\", 'source': '..\\\\Data\\\\PDFiles\\\\MachineLearningTomMitchell.pdf', 'total_pages': 421, 'page': 107, 'page_label': '108'}, page_content='head hid 4 who\\'d hood \\n0 bad \\n. hid \\n+ hod \\nr had \\nr hawed \\n. hoard \\no heed \\nc hud \\n, who\\'d \\nhood \\nFIGURE 4.5 \\nDecision regions of a multilayer feedforward network.

Given this fixed network structure, the main loop of the \\nalgorithm then repeatedly iterates over the training examples. For each training \\nexample, it applies the network to the example, calculates the error of the network \\noutput for this example, computes the gradient with respect to the error on this \\nexample, then updates all weights in the network. This gradient descent step is \\niterated (often thousands of times, using the same training examples multiple \\ntimes) until the network performs acceptably well. \\nThe gradient descent weight-update rule (Equation [T4.5] in Table 4.2) is \\nsimilar to the delta training rule (Equation [4.10]).

The exact form of aj follows from the derivation of the weight- \\ntuning rule given in Section 4.5.3. To understand it intuitively, first consider \\nhow ak is computed for each network output unit k (Equation [T4.3] in the al- \\ngorithm). ak is simply the familiar (tk - ok) from the delta rule, multiplied by \\nthe factor ok(l - ok), which is the derivative of the sigmoid squashing function. \\nThe ah value for each hidden unit h has a similar form (Equation [T4.4] in the \\nalgorithm).

This issue is discussed in greater detail in Section 4.6.5. \\n4.5.2.1 ADDING MOMENTUM \\nBecause BACKPROPAGATION is such a widely used algorithm, many variations have \\nbeen developed. Perhaps the most common is to alter the weight-update rule in \\nEquation (T4.5) in the algorithm by making the weight update on the nth iteration \\ndepend partially on the update that occurred during the (n - 1)th iteration, as \\nfollows: \\nHere Awji(n) is the weight update performed during the nth iteration through the \\nmain loop of the algorithm, and 0 5 a < 1 is a constant called the momentum. \\nNotice the first term on the right of this equation is just the weight-update rule of \\nEquation (T4.5) in the BACKPROPAGATION algorithm. The second term on the right \\nis new and is called the momentum term. To see the effect of this momentum \\nterm, consider that the gradient descent search trajectory is analogous to that \\nof a (momentumless) ball rolling down the error surface. The effect of a! is to \\nadd momentum that tends to keep the ball rolling in the same direction from \\none iteration to the next. This can sometimes have the effect of keeping the ball \\nrolling through small local minima in the error surface, or along flat regions in \\nthe surface where the ball would stop if there were no momentum. It also has \\nthe effect of gradually increasing the step size of the search in regions where the \\ngradient is unchanging, thereby speeding convergence. \\n4.5.2.2 LEARNING IN ARBITRARY ACYCLIC NETWORKS \\nThe definition of BACKPROPAGATION presented in Table 4.2 applies ohy to two- \\nlayer networks.

As a result, \\nBACKPROPAGATION over multilayer networks is only guaranteed to converge toward \\nsome local minimum in E and not necessarily to the global minimum error. \\nDespite the lack of assured convergence to the global minimum error, BACK- \\nPROPAGATION is a highly effective function approximation method in practice. In \\nmany practical applications the problem of local minima has not been found to \\nbe as severe as one might fear. To develop some intuition here, consider that \\nnetworks with large numbers of weights correspond to error surfaces in very high \\ndimensional spaces (one dimension per weight). When gradient descent falls into \\na local minimum with respect to one of these weights, it will not necessarily be \\nin a local minimum with respect to the other weights. In fact, the more weights in \\nthe network, the more dimensions that might provide \"escape routes\" for gradient \\ndescent to fall away from the local minimum with respect to this single weight. \\nA second perspective on local minima can be gained by considering the \\nmanner in which network weights evolve as the number of training iterations \\nincreases. Notice that if network weights are initialized to values near zero, then \\nduring early gradient descent steps the network will represent a very smooth \\nfunction that is approximately linear in its inputs. This is because the sigmoid \\nthreshold function itself is approximately linear when the weights are close to \\nzero (see the plot of the sigmoid function in Figure 4.6). Only after the weights \\nhave had time to grow will they reach a point where they can represent highly \\nnonlinear network functions. One might expect more local minima to exist in the \\nregion of the weight space that represents these more complex functions. One \\nhopes that by the time the weights reach this point they have already moved \\nclose enough to the global minimum that even local minima in this region are \\nacceptable. \\nDespite the above comments, gradient descent over the complex error sur- \\nfaces represented by ANNs is still poorly understood, and no methods are known to \\npredict with certainty when local minima will cause difficulties. Common heuris- \\ntics to attempt to alleviate the problem of local minima include: \\nAdd a momentum term to the weight-update rule as described in Equa- \\ntion (4.18).

Of course \\nthe answer depends on the width and depth of the networks. Although much is \\nstill unknown about which function classes can be described by which types of \\nnetworks, three quite general results are known: \\nBoolean functions. Every boolean function can be represented exactly by \\nsome network with two layers of units, although the number of hidden units \\nrequired grows exponentially in the worst case with the number of network \\ninputs. To see how this can be done, consider the following general scheme \\nfor representing an arbitrary boolean function: For each possible input vector, \\ncreate a distinct hidden unit and set its weights so that it activates if and only \\nif this specific vector is input to the network. This produces a hidden layer \\nthat will always have exactly one unit active. Now implement the output \\nunit as an OR gate that activates just for the desired input patterns. \\n0 Continuous functions. Every bounded continuous function can be approxi- \\nmated with arbitrarily small error (under a finite norm) by a network with \\ntwo layers of units (Cybenko 1989; Hornik et al. 1989). The theorem in \\nthis case applies to networks that use sigmoid units at the hidden layer and \\n(unthresholded) linear units at the output layer. The number of hidden units \\nrequired depends on the function to be approximated. \\nArbitraryfunctions. Any function can be approximated to arbitrary accuracy \\nby a network with three layers of units (Cybenko 1988). Again, the output \\nlayer uses linear units, the two hidden layers use sigmoid units, and the \\nnumber of units required at each layer is not known in general. The proof \\nof this involves showing that any function can be approximated by a lin- \\near combination of many localized functions that have value 0 everywhere \\nexcept for some small region, and then showing that two layers of sigmoid \\nunits are sufficient to produce good local approximations. \\nThese results show that limited depth feedfonvard networks provide a very \\nexpressive hypothesis space for BACKPROPAGATION.

Hertz et al. \\n(1991) provide a more detailed discussion of the above results. \\n4.6.3 Hypothesis Space Search and Inductive Bias \\nIt is interesting to compare the hypothesis space search of BACKPROPAGATION to \\nthe search performed by other learning algorithms. For BACKPROPAGATION, every \\npossible assignment of network weights represents a syntactically distinct hy- \\npothesis that in principle can be considered by the learner. In other words, the \\nhypothesis space is the n-dimensional Euclidean space of the n network weights. \\nNotice this hypothesis space is continuous, in contrast to the hypothesis spaces \\nof decision tree learning and other methods based on discrete representations. \\nThe fact that it is continuous, together with the fact that E is differentiable with \\nrespect to the continuous parameters of the hypothesis, results in a well-defined \\nerror gradient that provides a very useful structure for organizing the search for \\nthe best hypothesis. This structure is quite different from the general-to-specific \\nordering used to organize the search for symbolic concept learning algorithms, \\nor the simple-to-complex ordering over decision trees used by the ID3 and C4.5 \\nalgorithms. \\nWhat is the inductive bias by which BACKPROPAGATION generalizes beyond \\nthe observed data? It is difficult to characterize precisely the inductive bias of \\nBACKPROPAGATION learning, because it depends on the interplay between the gra- \\ndient descent search and the way in which the weight space spans the space of \\nrepresentable functions. However, one can roughly characterize it as smooth in- \\nterpolation between data points. Given two positive training examples with no \\nnegative examples between them, BACKPROPAGATION will tend to label points in \\nbetween as positive examples as well. This can be seen, for example, in the de- \\ncision surface illustrated in Figure 4.5, in which the specific sample of training \\nexamples gives rise to smoothly varying decision regions. \\n4.6.4 Hidden Layer Representations \\nOne intriguing property of BACKPROPAGATION is its ability to discover useful in- \\ntermediate representations at the hidden unit layers inside the network. Because \\ntraining examples constrain only the network inputs and outputs, the weight-tuning \\nprocedure is free to set weights that define whatever hidden unit representation is \\nmost effective at minimizing the squared error E. This can lead BACKPROPAGATION \\nto define new hidden layer features that are not explicit in the input representa- \\ntion, but which capture properties of the input instances that are most relevant to \\nlearning the target function. \\nConsider, for example, the network shown in Figure 4.7. Here, the eight \\nnetwork inputs are connected to three hidden units, which are in turn connected \\nto the eight output units.

The \\nnetwork must learn to reproduce the eight inputs at the corresponding eight output \\nunits. Although this is a simple function, the network in this case is constrained \\nto use only three hidden units. Therefore, the essential information from all eight \\ninput units must be captured by the three learned hidden units. \\nWhen BACKPROPAGATION is applied to this task, using each of the eight pos- \\nsible vectors as training examples, it successfully learns the target function. What \\nhidden layer representation is created by the gradient descent BACKPROPAGATION \\nalgorithm? By examining the hidden unit values generated by the learned network \\nfor each of the eight possible input vectors, it is easy to see that the learned en- \\ncoding is similar to the familiar standard binary encoding of eight values using \\nthree bits (e.g., 000,001,010,. . . , 111). The exact values of the hidden units for \\none typical run of BACKPROPAGATION are shown in Figure 4.7. \\nThis ability of multilayer networks to automatically discover useful repre- \\nsentations at the hidden layers is a key feature of ANN learning. In contrast to \\nlearning methods that are constrained to use only predefined features provided by \\nthe human designer, this provides an important degree of flexibility that allows \\nthe learner to invent features not explicitly introduced by the human designer. Of \\ncourse these invented features must still be computable as sigmoid unit functions \\nof the provided network inputs.

Most of the interesting weight changes occurred, \\nhowever, during the first 2500 iterations. \\nWe can directly observe the effect of BACKPROPAGATION'S gradient descent \\nsearch by plotting the squared output error as a function of the number of gradient \\ndescent search steps.

How can this occur? This occurs because the weights are being \\ntuned to fit idiosyncrasies of the training examples that are not representative of \\nthe general distribution of examples. The large number of weight parameters in \\nANNs provides many degrees of freedom for fitting such idiosyncrasies. \\nWhy does overfitting tend to occur during later iterations, but not during ear- \\nlier iterations? Consider that network weights are initialized to small random val- \\nues. With weights of nearly identical value, only very smooth decision surfaces are \\ndescribable. As training proceeds, some weights begin to grow in order to reduce \\nthe error over the training data, and the complexity of the learned decision surface \\nincreases. Thus, the effective complexity of the hypotheses that can be reached by \\nBACKPROPAGATION increases with the number of weight-tuning iterations. Given \\nenough weight-tuning iterations, BACKPROPAGATION will often be able to create \\noverly complex decision surfaces that fit noise in the training data or unrepresen- \\ntative characteristics of the particular training sample. This overfitting problem is \\nanalogous to the overfitting problem in decision tree learning (see Chapter 3). \\nSeveral techniques are available to address the overfitting problem for BACK- \\nPROPAGATION learning. One approach, known as weight decay, is to decrease each \\nweight by some small factor during each iteration. This is equivalent to modifying \\nthe definition of E to include a penalty term corresponding to the total magnitude \\nof the network weights. The motivation for this approach is to keep weight values \\nsmall, to bias learning against complex decision surfaces. \\nOne of the most successful methods for overcoming the overfitting problem \\nis to simply provide a set of validation data to the algorithm in addition to the \\ntraining data. The algorithm monitors the error with respect to this validation set, \\nwhile using the training set to drive the gradient descent search. In essence, this \\nallows the algorithm itself to plot the two curves shown in Figure 4.9. How many \\nweight-tuning iterations should the algorithm perform? Clearly, it should use the \\nnumber of iterations that produces the lowest error over the validation set, since \\nthis is the best indicator of network performance over unseen examples. In typical \\nimplementations of this approach, two copies of the network weights are kept: \\none copy for training and a separate copy of the best-performing weights thus far, \\nmeasured by their error over the validation set. Once the trained weights reach a \\nsignificantly higher error over the validation set than the stored weights, training \\nis terminated and the stored weights are returned as the final hypothesis. When \\nthis procedure is applied in the case of the top plot of Figure 4.9, it outputs the \\nnetwork weights obtained after 9100 iterations. The second plot in Figure 4.9 \\nshows that it is not always obvious when the lowest error on the validation set \\nhas been reached. In this plot, the validation set error decreases, then increases, \\nthen decreases again. Care must be taken to avoid the mistaken conclusion that \\nthe network has reached its lowest validation set error at iteration 850. \\nIn general, the issue of overfitting and how to overcome it is a subtle one. \\nThe above cross-validation approach works best when extra data are available to \\nprovide a validation set.

In these cases, a k-fold cross-validation approach \\nis sometimes used, in which cross validation is performed k different times, each \\ntime using a different partitioning of the data into training and validation sets, \\nand the results are then averaged.

Why not try it \\nyourself? \\n4.7.1 The Task \\nThe learning task here involves classifying camera images of faces of various \\npeople in various poses. Images of 20 different people were collected, including \\napproximately 32 images per person, varying the person's expression (happy, sad, \\nangry, neutral), the direction in which they were looking (left, right, straight ahead, \\nup), and whether or not they were wearing sunglasses. As can be seen from the \\nexample images in Figure 4.10, there is also variation in the background behind \\nthe person, the clothing worn by the person, and the position of the person's \\nface within the image. In total, 624 greyscale images were collected, each with a \\nresolution of 120 x 128, with each image pixel described by a greyscale intensity \\nvalue between 0 (black) and 255 (white). \\nA variety of target functions can be learned from this image data. For ex- \\nample, given an image as input we could train an ANN to output the identity of \\nthe person, the direction in which the person is facing, the gender of the person, \\nwhether or not they are wearing sunglasses, etc. All of these target functions can \\nbe learned to high accuracy from this image data, and the reader is encouraged \\nto try out these experiments. In the remainder of this section we consider one \\nparticular task: learning the direction in which the person is facing (to their left, \\nright, straight ahead, or upward).

We summarize these choices below for our task of learning the \\ndirection in which a person is facing. Although no attempt was made to determine \\nthe precise optimal design choices for this task, the design described here learns'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'macOS Version 11.2.3 (Build 20D91) Quartz PDFContext', 'creator': 'Preview', 'creationdate': \"D:20210312135113Z00'00'\", 'title': 'Machine - Learning - Tom Mitchell.pdf', 'moddate': \"D:20210312135113Z00'00'\", 'source': '..\\\\Data\\\\PDFiles\\\\MachineLearningTomMitchell.pdf', 'total_pages': 421, 'page': 125, 'page_label': '126'}, page_content='the target function quite well. After training on a set of 260 images, classification \\naccuracy over a separate test set is 90%. In contrast, the default accuracy achieved \\nby randomly guessing one of the four possible face directions is 25%. \\nInput encoding. Given that the ANN input is to be some representation of the \\nimage, one key design choice is how to encode this image. For example, we could \\npreprocess the image to extract edges, regions of uniform intensity, or other local \\nimage features, then input these features to the network. One difficulty with this \\ndesign option is that it would lead to a variable number of features (e.g., edges) \\nper image, whereas the ANN has a fixed number of input units. The design option \\nchosen in this case was instead to encode the image as a fixed set of 30 x 32 pixel \\nintensity values, with one network input per pixel. The pixel intensity values \\nranging from 0 to 255 were linearly scaled to range from 0 to 1 so that network \\ninputs would have values in the same interval as the hidden unit and output unit \\nactivations. The 30 x 32 pixel image is, in fact, a coarse resolution summary of \\nthe original 120 x 128 captured image, with each coarse pixel intensity calculated \\nas the mean of the corresponding high-resolution pixel intensities. Using this \\ncoarse-resolution image reduces the number of inputs and network weights to \\na much more manageable size, thereby reducing computational demands, while \\nmaintaining sufficient resolution to correctly classify the images. Recall from \\nFigure 4.1 that the ALVINN system uses a similar coarse-resolution image as \\ninput to the network. One interesting difference is that in ALVINN, each coarse \\nresolution pixel intensity is obtained by selecting the intensity of a single pixel at \\nrandom from the appropriate region within the high-resolution image, rather than \\ntaking the mean of all pixel intensities within this region. The motivation for this \\nic ALVINN is that it significantly reduces the computation required to produce the \\ncoarse-resolution image from the available high-resolution image. This efficiency \\nis especially important when the network must be used to process many images \\nper second while autonomously driving the vehicle. \\nOutput encoding. The ANN must output one of four values indicating the di- \\nrection in which the person is looking (left, right, up, or straight). Note we could \\nencode this four-way classification using a single output unit, assigning outputs \\nof, say, 0.2,0.4,0.6, and 0.8 to encode these four possible values. Instead, we \\nuse four distinct output units, each representing one of the four possible face di- \\nrections, with the highest-valued output taken as the network prediction. This is \\noften called a 1 -0f-n output encoding. There are two motivations for choosing the \\n1-of-n output encoding over the single unit option. First, it provides more degrees \\nof freedom to the network for representing the target function (i.e., there are n \\ntimes as many weights available in the output layer of units). Second, in the 1-of-n \\nencoding the difference between the highest-valued output and the second-highest \\ncan be used as a measure of the confidence in the network prediction (ambiguous \\nclassifications may result in near or exact ties). A further design choice here is \\n\"what should be the target values for these four output units?\\' One obvious choice \\nwould be to use the four target values (1,0,0,O) to encode a face looking to the'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'macOS Version 11.2.3 (Build 20D91) Quartz PDFContext', 'creator': 'Preview', 'creationdate': \"D:20210312135113Z00'00'\", 'title': 'Machine - Learning - Tom Mitchell.pdf', 'moddate': \"D:20210312135113Z00'00'\", 'source': '..\\\\Data\\\\PDFiles\\\\MachineLearningTomMitchell.pdf', 'total_pages': 421, 'page': 126, 'page_label': '127'}, page_content='left, (0,1,0,O) to encode a face looking straight, etc. Instead of 0 and 1 values, \\nwe use values of 0.1 and 0.9, so that (0.9,O. 1,0.1,0.1) is the target output vector \\nfor a face looking to the left. The reason for avoiding target values of 0 and 1 \\nis that sigmoid units cannot produce these output values given finite weights. If \\nwe attempt to train the network to fit target values of exactly 0 and 1, gradient \\ndescent will force the weights to grow without bound. On the other hand, values \\nof 0.1 and 0.9 are achievable using a sigmoid unit with finite weights. \\nNetwork graph structure. As described earlier, BACKPROPAGATION can be ap- \\nplied to any acyclic directed graph of sigmoid units. Therefore, another design \\nchoice we face is how many units to include in the network and how to inter- \\nconnect them. The most common network structure is a layered network with \\nfeedforward connections from every unit in one layer to every unit in the next. \\nIn the current design we chose this standard structure, using two layers of sig- \\nmoid units (one hidden layer and one output layer). It is common to use one or \\ntwo layers of sigmoid units and, occasionally, three layers. It is not common to \\nuse more layers than this because training times become very long and because \\nnetworks with three layers of sigmoid units can already express a rich variety of \\ntarget functions (see Section 4.6.2). Given our choice of a layered feedforward \\nnetwork with one hidden layer, how many hidden units should we include? In the \\nresults reported in Figure 4.10, only three hidden units were used, yielding a test \\nset accuracy of 90%. In other experiments 30 hidden units were used, yielding a \\ntest set accuracy one to two percent higher. Although the generalization accuracy \\nvaried only a small amount between these two experiments, the second experiment \\nrequired significantly more training time. Using 260 training images, the training \\ntime was approximately 1 hour on a Sun Sparc5 workstation for the 30 hidden unit \\nnetwork, compared to approximately 5 minutes for the 3 hidden unit network. In \\nmany applications it has been found that some minimum number of hidden units \\nis required in order to learn the target function accurately and that extra hidden \\nunits above this number do not dramatically affect generalization accuracy, pro- \\nvided cross-validation methods are used to determine how many gradient descent \\niterations should be performed. If such methods are not used, then increasing the \\nnumber of hidden units often increases the tendency to overfit the training data, \\nthereby reducing generalization accuracy. \\nOther learning algorithm parameters. In these learning experiments the learn- \\ning rate r] was set to 0.3, and the momentum a! was set to 0.3. Lower values for both \\nparameters produced roughly equivalent generalization accuracy, but longer train- \\ning times. If these values are set too high, training fails to converge to a network \\nwith acceptable error over the training set. Full gradient descent was used in all \\nthese experiments (in contrast to the stochastic approximation to gradient descent \\nin the algorithm of Table 4.2). Network weights in the output units were initial- \\nized to small random values. However, input unit weights were initialized to zero, \\nbecause this yields much more intelligible visualizations of the learned weights \\n(see Figure 4.10), without any noticeable impact on generalization accuracy.

The final \\nreported accuracy (e-g., 90% for the network in Figure 4.10) was measured over \\nyet a third set of test examples that were not used in any way to influence training. \\n4.7.3 Learned Hidden Representations \\nIt is interesting to examine the learned weight values for the 2899 weights in the \\nnetwork. Figure 4.10 depicts the values of each of these weights after one iteration \\nthrough the weight update for all training examples, and again after 100 iterations. \\nTo understand this diagram, consider first the four rectangular blocks just \\nbelow the face images in the figure. Each of these rectangles depicts the weights \\nfor one of the four output units in the network (encoding left, straight, right, and \\nup). The four squares within each rectangle indicate the four weights associated \\nwith this output unit-the weight wo, which determines the unit threshold (on \\nthe left), followed by the three weights connecting the three hidden units to this \\noutput. The brightness of the square indicates the weight value, with bright white \\nindicating a large positive weight, dark black indicating a large negative weight, \\nand intermediate shades of grey indicating intermediate weight values. For ex- \\nample, the output unit labeled \"up\" has a near zero wo threshold weight, a large \\npositive weight from the first hidden unit, and a large negative weight from the \\nsecond hidden unit. \\nThe weights of the hidden units are shown directly below those for the output \\nunits. Recall that each hidden unit receives an input from each of the 30 x 32 \\nimage pixels. The 30 x 32 weights associated with these inputs are displayed so \\nthat each weight is in the position of the corresponding image pixel (with the wo \\nthreshold weight superimposed in the top left of the array). Interestingly, one can \\nsee that the weights have taken on values that are especially sensitive to features \\nin the region of the image in which the face and body typically appear. \\nThe values of the network weights after 100 gradient descent iterations \\nthrough each training example are shown at the bottom of the figure. Notice the \\nleftmost hidden unit has very different weights than it had after the first iteration, \\nand the other two hidden units have changed as well. It is possible to understand \\nto some degree the encoding in this final set of weights. For example, consider the \\noutput unit that indicates a person is looking to his right. This unit has a strong \\npositive weight from the second hidden unit and a strong negative weight from \\nthe third hidden unit. Examining the weights of these two hidden units, it is easy \\nto see that if the person\\'s face is turned to his right (i.e., our left), then his bright \\nskin will roughly align with strong positive weights in this hidden unit, and his \\ndark hair will roughly align with negative weights, resulting in this unit outputting \\na large value. The same image will cause the third hidden unit to output a value'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'macOS Version 11.2.3 (Build 20D91) Quartz PDFContext', 'creator': 'Preview', 'creationdate': \"D:20210312135113Z00'00'\", 'title': 'Machine - Learning - Tom Mitchell.pdf', 'moddate': \"D:20210312135113Z00'00'\", 'source': '..\\\\Data\\\\PDFiles\\\\MachineLearningTomMitchell.pdf', 'total_pages': 421, 'page': 128, 'page_label': '129'}, page_content=\"close to zero, as the bright face will tend to align with the large negative weights \\nin this case. \\n4.8 ADVANCED TOPICS IN ARTIFICIAL NEURAL NETWORKS \\n4.8.1 Alternative Error Functions \\nAs noted earlier, gradient descent can be performed for any function E that is \\ndifferentiable with respect to the parameterized hypothesis space. While the basic \\nBAcWROPAGATION algorithm defines E in terms of the sum of squared errors \\nof the network, other definitions have been suggested in order to incorporate \\nother constraints into the weight-tuning rule. For each new definition of E a new \\nweight-tuning rule for gradient descent must be derived. Examples of alternative \\ndefinitions of E include \\na Adding a penalty term for weight magnitude. As discussed above, we can \\nadd a term to E that increases with the magnitude of the weight vector. \\nThis causes the gradient descent search to seek weight vectors with small \\nmagnitudes, thereby reducing the risk of overfitting. One way to do this is \\nto redefine E as \\nwhich yields a weight update rule identical to the BACKPROPAGATION rule, \\nexcept that each weight is multiplied by the constant (1 - 2yq) upon each \\niteration. Thus, choosing this definition of E is equivalent to using a weight \\ndecay strategy (see Exercise 4.10.) \\na Adding a term for errors in the slope, or derivative of the target func- \\ntion. In some cases, training information may be available regarding desired \\nderivatives of the target function, as well as desired values. For example, \\nSimard et al. (1992) describe an application to character recognition in which \\ncertain training derivatives are used to constrain the network to learn char- \\nacter recognition functions that are invariant of translation within the im- \\nage. Mitchell and Thrun (1993) describe methods for calculating training \\nderivatives based on the learner's prior knowledge. In both of these sys- \\ntems (described in Chapter 12), the error function is modified to add a term \\nmeasuring the discrepancy between these training derivatives and the actual \\nderivatives of the learned network. One example of such an error function is \\nHere x: denotes the value of the jth input unit for training example d. \\nThus, 2 is the training derivative describing how the target output value\"), Document(metadata={'producer': 'macOS Version 11.2.3 (Build 20D91) Quartz PDFContext', 'creator': 'Preview', 'creationdate': \"D:20210312135113Z00'00'\", 'title': 'Machine - Learning - Tom Mitchell.pdf', 'moddate': \"D:20210312135113Z00'00'\", 'source': '..\\\\Data\\\\PDFiles\\\\MachineLearningTomMitchell.pdf', 'total_pages': 421, 'page': 129, 'page_label': '130'}, page_content='118 MACHINE LEARNING \\ntkd should vary with a change in the input xi. Similarly, 9 denotes the \\nax, \\ncorresponding derivative of the actual learned network. The constant ,u de- \\ntermines the relative weight placed on fitting the training values versus the \\ntraining derivatives. \\n0 Minimizing the cross entropy of the network with respect to the target values. \\nConsider learning a probabilistic function, such as predicting whether a loan \\napplicant will pay back a loan based on attributes such as the applicant\\'s age \\nand bank balance. Although the training examples exhibit only boolean target \\nvalues (either a 1 or 0, depending on whether this applicant paid back the \\nloan), the underlying target function might be best modeled by outputting the \\nprobability that the given applicant will repay the loan, rather than attempting \\nto output the actual 1 and 0 value for each input instance. Given such \\nsituations in which we wish for the network to output probability estimates, \\nit can be shown that the best (i.e., maximum likelihood) probability estimates \\nare given by the network that minimizes the cross entropy, defined as \\nHere od is the probability estimate output by the network for training ex- \\nample d, and td is the 1 or 0 target value for training example d. Chapter 6 \\ndiscusses when and why the most probable network hypothesis is the one \\nthat minimizes this cross entropy and derives the corresponding gradient \\ndescent weight-tuning rule for sigmoid units. That chapter also describes \\nother conditions under which the most probable hypothesis is the one that \\nminimizes the sum of squared errors. \\n0 Altering the effective error function can also be accomplished by weight \\nsharing, or \"tying together\" weights associated with different units or inputs. \\nThe idea here is that different network weights are forced to take on identical \\nvalues, usually to enforce some constraint known in advance to the human \\ndesigner. For example, Waibel et al. (1989) and Lang et al. (1990) describe \\nan application of neural networks to speech recognition, in which the net- \\nwork inputs are the speech frequency components at different times within a \\n144 millisecond time window. One assumption that can be made in this ap- \\nplication is that the frequency components that identify a specific sound (e.g., \\n\"eee\") should be independent of the exact time that the sound occurs within \\nthe 144 millisecond window. To enforce this constraint, the various units that \\nreceive input from different portions of the time window are forced to share \\nweights. The net effect is to constrain the space of potential hypotheses, \\nthereby reducing the risk of overfitting and improving the chances for accu- \\nrately generalizing to unseen situations. Such weight sharing is typically im- \\nplemented by first updating each of the shared weights separately within each \\nunit that uses the weight, then replacing each instance of the shared weight by \\nthe mean of their values. The result of this procedure is that shared weights \\neffectively adapt to a different error function than do the unshared weights.'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'macOS Version 11.2.3 (Build 20D91) Quartz PDFContext', 'creator': 'Preview', 'creationdate': \"D:20210312135113Z00'00'\", 'title': 'Machine - Learning - Tom Mitchell.pdf', 'moddate': \"D:20210312135113Z00'00'\", 'source': '..\\\\Data\\\\PDFiles\\\\MachineLearningTomMitchell.pdf', 'total_pages': 421, 'page': 130, 'page_label': '131'}, page_content=\"4.8.2 Alternative Error Minimization Procedures \\nWhile gradient descent is one of the most general search methods for finding a \\nhypothesis to minimize the error function, it is not always the most efficient. It \\nis not uncommon for BACKPROPAGATION to require tens of thousands of iterations \\nthrough the weight update loop when training complex networks. For this reason, \\na number of alternative weight optimization algorithms have been proposed and \\nexplored. To see some of the other possibilities, it is helpful to think of a weight- \\nupdate method as involving two decisions: choosing a direction in which to alter \\nthe current weight vector and choosing a distance to move. In BACKPROPAGATION, \\nthe direction is chosen by taking the negative of the gradient, and the distance is \\ndetermined by the learning rate constant q. \\nOne optimization method, known as line search, involves a different ap- \\nproach to choosing the distance for the weight update. In particular, once a line is \\nchosen that specifies the direction of the update, the update distance is chosen by \\nfinding the minimum of the error function along this line. Notice this can result \\nin a very large or very small weight update, depending on the position of the \\npoint along the line that minimizes error. A second method, that builds on the \\nidea of line search, is called the conjugate gradient method. Here, a sequence of \\nline searshes is performed to search for a minimum in the error surface. On the \\nfirst step in this sequence, the direction chosen is the negative of the gradient. \\nOn each subsequent step, a new direction is chosen so that the component of the \\nerror gradient that has just been made zero, remains zero. \\nWhile alternative error-minimization methods sometimes lead to improved \\nefficiency in training the network, methods such as conjugate gradient tend to \\nhave no significant impact on the generalization error of the final network. The \\nonly likely impact on the final error is that different error-minimization procedures \\nmay fall into different local minima. Bishop (1996) contains a general discussion \\nof several parameter optimization methods for training networks. \\n4.8.3 Recurrent Networks \\nUp to this point we have considered only network topologies that correspond \\nto acyclic directed graphs. Recurrent networks are artificial neural networks that \\napply to time series data and that use outputs of network units at time t as the \\ninput to other units at time t + 1. In this way, they support a form of directed \\ncycles in the network. To illustrate, consider the time series prediction task of \\npredicting the next day's stock market average y(t + 1) based on the current day's \\neconomic indicators x(t). Given a time series of such data, one obvious approach \\nis to train a feedforward network to predict y(t + 1) as its output, based on the \\ninput values x(t). Such a network is shown in Figure 4.11(a). \\nOne limitation of such a network is that the prediction of y(t + 1) depends \\nonly on x(t) and cannot capture possible dependencies of y (t + 1) on earlier values \\nof x. This might be necessary, for example, if tomorrow's stock market average \\n~(t + 1) depends on the difference between today's economic indicator values \\nx(t) and yesterday's values x(t - 1).

Of course in practice \\nwe wish to keep only one copy of the recurrent network and one set of weights. \\nTherefore, after training the unfolded network, the final weight wji in the recurrent \\nnetwork can be taken to be the mean value of the corresponding wji weights in \\nthe various copies. Mozer (1995) describes this training process in greater detail. \\nIn practice, recurrent networks are more difficult to train than networks with no \\nfeedback loops and do not generalize as reliably. However, they remain important \\ndue to their increased representational power. \\n4.8.4 Dynamically Modifying Network Structure \\nUp to this point we have considered neural network learning as a problem of \\nadjusting weights within a fixed graph structure. A variety of methods have been \\nproposed to dynamically grow or shrink the number of network units and intercon- \\nnections in an attempt to improve generalization accuracy and training efficiency. \\nOne idea is to begin with a network containing no hidden units, then grow \\nthe network as needed by adding hidden units until the training error is reduced \\nto some acceptable level. The CASCADE-CORRELATION algorithm (Fahlman and \\nLebiere 1990) is one such algorithm. CASCADE-CORRELATION begins by construct- \\ning a network with no hidden units. In the case of our face-direction learning task, \\nfor example, it would construct a network containing only the four output units \\ncompletely connected to the 30 x 32 input nodes. After this network is trained for \\nsome time, we may well find that there remains a significant residual error due \\nto the fact that the target function cannot be perfectly represented by a network \\nwith this single-layer structure. In this case, the algorithm adds a hidden unit, \\nchoosing its weight values to maximize the correlation between the hidden unit \\nvalue and the residual error of the overall network. The new unit is now installed \\ninto the network, with its weight values held fixed, and a new connection from \\nthis new unit is added to each output unit. The process is now repeated. The \\noriginal weights are retrained (holding the hidden unit weights fixed), the residual \\nerror is checked, and a second hidden unit added if the residual error is still above \\nthreshold. Whenever a new hidden unit is added, its inputs include all of the orig- \\ninal network inputs plus the outputs of any existing hidden units. The network is'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'macOS Version 11.2.3 (Build 20D91) Quartz PDFContext', 'creator': 'Preview', 'creationdate': \"D:20210312135113Z00'00'\", 'title': 'Machine - Learning - Tom Mitchell.pdf', 'moddate': \"D:20210312135113Z00'00'\", 'source': '..\\\\Data\\\\PDFiles\\\\MachineLearningTomMitchell.pdf', 'total_pages': 421, 'page': 133, 'page_label': '134'}, page_content='122 MACHINE LEARNING \\ngrown in this fashion, accumulating hidden units until the network residual enor \\nis reduced to some acceptable level. Fahlman and Lebiere (1990) report cases in \\nwhich CASCADE-CORRELATION significantly reduces training times, due to the fact \\nthat only a single layer of units is trained at each step. One practical difficulty \\nis that because the algorithm can add units indefinitely, it is quite easy for it to \\noverfit the training data, and precautions to avoid overfitting must be taken. \\nA second idea for dynamically altering network structure is to take the \\nopposite approach. Instead of beginning with the simplest possible network and \\nadding complexity, we begin with a complex network and prune it as we find that \\ncertain connections are inessential. One way to decide whether a particular weight \\nis inessential is to see whether its value is close to zero. A second way, which \\nappears to be more successful in practice, is to consider the effect that a small \\nvariation in the weight has on the error E. The effect on E of varying w (i.e., g) \\ncan be taken as a measure of the salience of the connection. LeCun et al. (1990) \\ndescribe a process in which a network is trained, the least salient connections \\nremoved, and this process iterated until some termination condition is met. They \\nrefer to this as the \"optimal brain damage\" approach, because at each step the \\nalgorithm attempts to remove the least useful connections. They report that in \\na character recognition application this approach reduced the number of weights \\nin a large network by a factor of 4, with a slight improvement in generalization \\naccuracy and a significant improvement in subsequent training efficiency. \\nIn general, techniques for dynamically modifying network structure have \\nmet with mixed success. It remains to be seen whether they can reliably improve \\non the generalization accuracy of BACKPROPAGATION. However, they have been \\nshown in some cases to provide significant improvements in training times. \\n4.9 SUMMARY AND FURTHER READING \\nMain points of this chapter include: \\n0 Artificial neural network learning provides a practical method for learning \\nreal-valued and vector-valued functions over continuous and discrete-valued \\nattributes, in a way that is robust to noise in the training data. The BACKPROP- \\nAGATION algorithm is the most common network learning method and has \\nbeen successfully applied to a variety of learning tasks, such as handwriting \\nrecognition and robot control. \\n0 The hypothesis space considered by the BACKPROPAGATION algorithm is the \\nspace of all functions that can be represented by assigning weights to the \\ngiven, fixed network of interconnected units. Feedforward networks contain- \\ning three layers of units are able to approximate any function to arbitrary \\naccuracy, given a sufficient (potentially very large) number of units in each \\nlayer. Even networks of practical size are capable of representing a rich \\nspace of highly nonlinear functions, making feedforward networks a good \\nchoice for learning discrete and continuous functions whose general form is \\nunknown in advance.'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'macOS Version 11.2.3 (Build 20D91) Quartz PDFContext', 'creator': 'Preview', 'creationdate': \"D:20210312135113Z00'00'\", 'title': 'Machine - Learning - Tom Mitchell.pdf', 'moddate': \"D:20210312135113Z00'00'\", 'source': '..\\\\Data\\\\PDFiles\\\\MachineLearningTomMitchell.pdf', 'total_pages': 421, 'page': 134, 'page_label': '135'}, page_content='BACKPROPAGATION searches the space of possible hypotheses using gradient \\ndescent to iteratively reduce the error in the network fit to the training \\nexamples. Gradient descent converges to a local minimum in the training \\nerror with respect to the network weights. More generally, gradient descent is \\na potentially useful method for searching many continuously parameterized \\nhypothesis spaces where the training error is a differentiable function of \\nhypothesis parameters. \\nOne of the most intriguing properties of BACKPROPAGATION is its ability to \\ninvent new features that are not explicit in the input to the network. In par- \\nticular, the internal (hidden) layers of multilayer networks learn to represent \\nintermediate features that are useful for learning the target function and that \\nare only implicit in the network inputs. This capability is illustrated, for ex- \\nample, by the ability of the 8 x 3 x 8 network in Section 4.6.4 to invent the \\nboolean encoding of digits from 1 to 8 and by the image features represented \\nby the hidden layer in the face-recognition application of Section 4.7. \\nOverfitting the training data is an important issue in ANN learning. Overfit- \\nting results in networks that generalize poorly to new data despite excellent \\nperformance over the training data. Cross-validation methods can be used to \\nestimate an appropriate stopping point for gradient descent search and thus \\nto minimize the risk of overfitting. \\n0 Although BACKPROPAGATION is the most common ANN learning algorithm, \\nmany others have been proposed, including algorithms for more specialized \\ntasks. For example, recurrent neural network methods train networks con- \\ntaining directed cycles, and algorithms such as CASCADE CORRELATION alter \\nthe network structure as well as the network weights. \\nAdditional information on ANN learning can be found in several other chap- \\nters in this book. A Bayesian justification for choosing to minimize the sum of \\nsquared errors is given in Chapter 6, along with a justification for minimizing \\nthe cross-entropy instead of the sum of squared errors in other cases. Theoretical \\nresults characterizing the number of training examples needed to reliably learn \\nboolean functions and the Vapnik-Chervonenkis dimension of certain types of \\nnetworks can be found in Chapter 7. A discussion of overfitting and how to avoid \\nit can be found in Chapter 5.

This chapter presents an introduction to statistical methods for estimating hy- \\npothesis accuracy, focusing on three questions. First, given the observed accuracy \\nof a hypothesis over a limited sample of data, how well does this estimate its ac- \\ncuracy over additional examples? Second, given that one hypothesis outperforms \\nanother over some sample of data, how probable is it that this hypothesis is more \\naccurate in general? Third, when data is limited what is the best way to use this \\ndata to both learn a hypothesis and estimate its accuracy? Because limited samples \\nof data might misrepresent the general distribution of data, estimating true accuracy \\nfrom such samples can be misleading. Statistical methods, together with assump- \\ntions about the underlying distributions of data, allow one to bound the difference \\nbetween observed accuracy over the sample of available data and the true accuracy \\nover the entire distribution of data. \\n5.1 MOTIVATION \\nIn many cases it is important to evaluate the performance of learned hypotheses \\nas precisely as possible. One reason is simply to understand whether to use the \\nhypothesis. For instance, when learning from a limited-size database indicating \\nthe effectiveness of different medical treatments, it is important to understand as \\nprecisely as possible the accuracy of the learned hypotheses. A second reason is \\nthat evaluating hypotheses is an integral component of many learning methods. \\nFor example, in post-pruning decision trees to avoid overfitting, we must evaluate'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'macOS Version 11.2.3 (Build 20D91) Quartz PDFContext', 'creator': 'Preview', 'creationdate': \"D:20210312135113Z00'00'\", 'title': 'Machine - Learning - Tom Mitchell.pdf', 'moddate': \"D:20210312135113Z00'00'\", 'source': '..\\\\Data\\\\PDFiles\\\\MachineLearningTomMitchell.pdf', 'total_pages': 421, 'page': 140, 'page_label': '141'}, page_content='the impact of possible pruning steps on the accuracy of the resulting decision tree. \\nTherefore it is important to understand the likely errors inherent in estimating the \\naccuracy of the pruned and unpruned tree. \\nEstimating the accuracy of a hypothesis is relatively straightforward when \\ndata is plentiful. However, when we must learn a hypothesis and estimate its \\nfuture accuracy given only a limited set of data, two key difficulties arise: \\nBias in the estimate. First, the observed accuracy of the learned hypothesis \\nover the training examples is often a poor estimator of its accuracy over \\nfuture examples. Because the learned hypothesis was derived from these \\nexamples, they will typically provide an optimistically biased estimate of \\nhypothesis accuracy over future examples. This is especially likely when \\nthe learner considers a very rich hypothesis space, enabling it to overfit the \\ntraining examples. To obtain an unbiased estimate of future accuracy, we \\ntypically test the hypothesis on some set of test examples chosen indepen- \\ndently of the training examples and the hypothesis. \\na Variance in the estimate. Second, even if the hypothesis accuracy is mea- \\nsured over an unbiased set of test examples independent of the training \\nexamples, the measured accuracy can still vary from the true accuracy, de- \\npending on the makeup of the particular set of test examples. The smaller \\nthe set of test examples, the greater the expected variance. \\nThis chapter discusses methods for evaluating learned hypotheses, methods \\nfor comparing the accuracy of two hypotheses, and methods for comparing the \\naccuracy of two learning algorithms when only limited data is available. Much \\nof the discussion centers on basic principles from statistics and sampling theory, \\nthough the chapter assumes no special background in statistics on the part of the \\nreader. The literature on statistical tests for hypotheses is very large. This chapter \\nprovides an introductory overview that focuses only on the issues most directly \\nrelevant to learning, evaluating, and comparing hypotheses. \\n5.2 ESTIMATING HYPOTHESIS ACCURACY \\nWhen evaluating a learned hypothesis we are most often interested in estimating \\nthe accuracy with which it will classify future instances. At the same time, we \\nwould like to know the probable error in this accuracy estimate (i.e., what error \\nbars to associate with this estimate). \\nThroughout this chapter we consider the following setting for the learning \\nproblem. There is some space of possible instances X (e.g., the set of all people) \\nover which various target functions may be defined (e.g., people who plan to \\npurchase new skis this year).

You are given a worn and bent coin and asked to estimate the probability \\nthat the coin will turn up heads when tossed. Let us call this unknown probability \\nof heads p. You toss the coin n times and record the number of times r that it \\nturns up heads. A reasonable estimate of p is rln. Note that if the experiment \\nwere rerun, generating a new set of n coin tosses, we might expect the number \\nof heads r to vary somewhat from the value measured in the first experiment, \\nyielding a somewhat different estimate for p. The Binomial distribution describes \\nfor each possible value of r (i.e., from 0 to n), the probability of observing exactly \\nr heads given a sample of n independent tosses of a coin whose true probability \\nof heads is p. \\nInterestingly, estimating p from a random sample of coin tosses is equivalent \\nto estimating errorv(h) from testing h on a random sample of instances. A single \\ntoss of the coin corresponds to drawing a single random instance from 23 and \\ndetermining whether it is misclassified by h. The probability p that a single random \\ncoin toss will turn up heads corresponds to the probability that a single instance \\ndrawn at random will be misclassified (i.e., p corresponds to errorv(h)). The \\nnumber r of heads observed over a sample of n coin tosses corresponds to the \\nnumber of misclassifications observed over n randomly drawn instances. Thus rln \\ncorresponds to errors(h). The problem of estimating p for coins is identical to \\nthe problem of estimating errorv(h) for hypotheses. The Binomial distribution \\ngives the general form of the probability distribution for the random variable r, \\nwhether it represents the number of heads in n coin tosses or the number of \\nhypothesis errors in a sample of n examples. The detailed form of the Binomial \\ndistribution depends on the specific sample size n and the specific probability p \\nor errorv(h). \\nThe general setting to which the Binomial distribution applies is: \\n1. There is a base, or underlying, experiment (e.g., toss of the coin) whose \\noutcome can be described by a random variable, say Y. The random variable \\nY can take on two possible values (e.g., Y = 1 if heads, Y = 0 if tails). \\n2. The probability that Y = 1 on any single trial of the underlying experiment \\nis given by some constant p, independent of the outcome of any other \\nexperiment. The probability that Y = 0 is therefore (1 - p). Typically, p is \\nnot known in advance, and the problem is to estimate it. \\n3.

Given a choice \\namong alternative unbiased estimators, it makes sense to choose the one with \\nleast variance.

In some cases, we will be \\ninterested only in a one-sided bound. For example, we might be interested in the \\nquestion \"What is the probability that errorz,(h) is at most U?\\' This kind of one- \\nsided question is natural when we are only interested in bounding the maximum \\nerror of h and do not mind if the true error is much smaller than estimated. \\nThere is an easy modification to the above procedure for finding such one- \\nsided error bounds. It follows from the fact that the Normal distribution is syrnrnet- \\nric about its mean. Because of this fact, any two-sided confidence interval based on \\na Normal distribution can be converted to a corresponding one-sided interval with \\ntwice the confidence (see Figure 5.l(b)). That is, a 100(1- a)% confidence inter- \\nval with lower bound L and upper bound U implies a 100(1- a/2)% confidence \\ninterval with lower bound L and no upper bound. It also implies a 100(1 -a/2)% \\nconfidence interval with upper bound U and no lower bound. Here a corresponds \\nto the probability that the correct value lies outside the stated interval. In other \\nwords, a is the probability that the value will fall into the unshaded region in \\nFigure 5.l(a), and a/2 is the probability that it will fall into the unshaded region \\nin Figure 5.l(b). \\nTo illustrate, consider again the example in which h commits r = 12 errors \\nover a sample of n = 40 independently drawn examples. As discussed above, \\nthis leads to a (two-sided) 95% confidence interval of 0.30 f 0.14. In this case, \\n100(1 - a) = 95%, so a! = 0.05.

The approach \\ndescribed there illustrates a general approach followed in many estima6on prob- \\nlems. In particular, we can see this as a problem of estimating the mean (expected \\nvalue) of a population based on the mean of a randomly drawn sample of size n. \\nThe general process includes the following steps: \\n1.

Determine the N% confidence interval by finding thresholds L and U such \\nthat N% of the mass in the probability distribution Vy falls between L and U. \\nIn later sections of this chapter we apply this general approach to sev- \\neral other estimation problems common in machine learning.

In an attempt \\nto estimate the mean p of the distribution governing the Yi, we calculate the sam- \\nple mean = '& Yi (e.g., the fraction of heads among the n coin tosses). \\nThe Central Limit Theorem states that the probability distribution governing Fn \\napproaches a Normal distribution as n + co, regardless of the distribution that \\ngoverns the underlying random variables Yi. Furthermore, the mean of the dis- \\ntribution governing Yn approaches p and the standard deviation approaches k. \\nMore precisely, \\nTheorem 5.1. Central Limit Theorem.

A \\nsecond popular approach is to randomly choose a test set of at least 30 examples \\nfrom Do, use the remaining examples for training, then repeat this process as \\nmany times as desired. This randomized method has the advantage that it can be \\nrepeated an indefinite number of times, to shrink the confidence interval to the \\ndesired width. In contrast, the k-fold method is limited by the total number of \\nexamples, by the use of each example only once in a test set, and by our desire \\nto use samples of size at least 30. However, the randomized method has the dis- \\nadvantage that the test sets no longer qualify as being independently drawn with \\nrespect to the underlying instance distribution D. In contrast, the test sets gener- \\nated by k-fold cross validation are independent because each instance is included \\nin only one test set. \\nTo summarize, no single procedure for comparing learning methods based \\non limited data satisfies all the constraints we would like. It is wise to keep in \\nmind that statistical models rarely fit perfectly the practical constraints in testing \\nlearning algorithms when available data is limited. Nevertheless, they do pro- \\nvide approximate confidence intervals that can be of great help in interpreting \\nexperimental comparisons of learning methods. \\n5.7 SUMMARY AND FURTHER READING \\nThe main points of this chapter include: \\n0 Statistical theory provides a basis for estimating the true error (errorv(h)) \\nof a hypothesis h, based on its observed error (errors(h)) over a sample S of \\ndata. For example, if h is a discrete-valued hypothesis and the data sample \\nS contains n 2 30 examples drawn independently of h and of one another, \\nthen the N% confidence interval for errorv(h) is approximately \\nwhere values for zN are given in Table 5.1. \\n0 In general, the problem of estimating confidence intervals is approached by \\nidentifying the parameter to be estimated (e.g., errorD(h)) and an estimator\"), Document(metadata={'producer': 'macOS Version 11.2.3 (Build 20D91) Quartz PDFContext', 'creator': 'Preview', 'creationdate': \"D:20210312135113Z00'00'\", 'title': 'Machine - Learning - Tom Mitchell.pdf', 'moddate': \"D:20210312135113Z00'00'\", 'source': '..\\\\Data\\\\PDFiles\\\\MachineLearningTomMitchell.pdf', 'total_pages': 421, 'page': 162, 'page_label': '163'}, page_content='CHAFER 5 EVALUATING HYPOTHESES 151 \\n(e.g., errors(h)) for this quantity. Because the estimator is a random variable \\n(e.g., errors(h) depends on the random sample S), it can be characterized \\nby the probability distribution that governs its value. Confidence intervals \\ncan then be calculated by determining the interval that contains the desired \\nprobability mass under this distribution. \\n0 One possible cause of errors in estimating hypothesis accuracy is estimation \\nbias. If Y is an estimator for some parameter p, the estimation bias of Y \\nis the difference between p and the expected value of Y. For example, if S \\nis the training data used to formulate hypothesis h, then errors(h) gives an \\noptimistically biased estimate of the true error errorD(h). \\n0 A second cause of estimation error is variance in the estimate. Even with an \\nunbiased estimator, the observed value of the estimator is likely to vary from \\none experiment to another. The variance a2 of the distribution governing the \\nestimator characterizes how widely this estimate is likely to vary from the \\ncorrect value. This variance decreases as the size of the data sample is \\nincreased. \\n0 Comparing the relative effectiveness of two learning algorithms is an esti- \\nmation problem that is relatively easy when data and time are unlimited, but \\nmore difficult when these resources are limited. One possible approach de- \\nscribed in this chapter is to run the learning algorithms on different subsets \\nof the available data, testing the learned hypotheses on the remaining data, \\nthen averaging the results of these experiments. \\n0 In most cases considered here, deriving confidence intervals involves making \\na number of assumptions and approximations. For example, the above confi- \\ndence interval for errorv(h) involved approximating a Binomial distribution \\nby a Normal distribution, approximating the variance of this distribution, and \\nassuming instances are generated by a fixed, unchanging probability distri- \\nbution. While intervals based on such approximations are only approximate \\nconfidence intervals, they nevertheless provide useful guidance for designing \\nand interpreting experimental results in machine learning. \\nThe key statistical definitions presented in this chapter are summarized in \\nTable 5.2. \\nAn ocean of literature exists on the topic of statistical methods for estimating \\nmeans and testing significance of hypotheses.

It is based on \\nthe assumption that the quantities of interest are governed by probability distri- \\nbutions and that optimal decisions can be made by reasoning about these proba- \\nbilities together with observed data. It is important to machine learning because \\nit provides a quantitative approach to weighing the evidence supporting alterna- \\ntive hypotheses.

First, Bayesian learning algorithms that calculate explicit \\nprobabilities for hypotheses, such as the naive Bayes classifier, are among the most \\npractical approaches to certain types of learning problems. For example, Michie \\net al. (1994) provide a detailed study comparing the naive Bayes classifier to \\nother learning algorithms, including decision tree and neural network algorithms. \\nThese researchers show that the naive Bayes classifier is competitive with these \\nother learning algorithms in many cases and that in some cases it outperforms \\nthese other methods. In this chapter we describe the naive Bayes classifier and \\nprovide a detailed example of its use. In particular, we discuss its application to \\nthe problem of learning to classify text documents such as electronic news articles.'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'macOS Version 11.2.3 (Build 20D91) Quartz PDFContext', 'creator': 'Preview', 'creationdate': \"D:20210312135113Z00'00'\", 'title': 'Machine - Learning - Tom Mitchell.pdf', 'moddate': \"D:20210312135113Z00'00'\", 'source': '..\\\\Data\\\\PDFiles\\\\MachineLearningTomMitchell.pdf', 'total_pages': 421, 'page': 166, 'page_label': '167'}, page_content='CHAFER 6 BAYESIAN LEARNING 155 \\nFor such learning tasks, the naive Bayes classifier is among the most effective \\nalgorithms known. \\nThe second reason that Bayesian methods are important to our study of ma- \\nchine learning is that they provide a useful perspective for understanding many \\nlearning algorithms that do not explicitly manipulate probabilities. For exam- \\nple, in this chapter we analyze algorithms such as the FIND-S and CANDIDATE- \\nELIMINATION algorithms of Chapter 2 to determine conditions under which they \\noutput the most probable hypothesis given the training data. We also use a \\nBayesian analysis to justify a key design choice in neural network learning al- \\ngorithms: choosing to minimize the sum of squared errors when searching the \\nspace of possible neural networks. We also derive an alternative error function, \\ncross entropy, that is more appropriate than sum of squared errors when learn- \\ning target functions that predict probabilities. We use a Bayesian perspective to \\nanalyze the inductive bias of decision tree learning algorithms that favor short \\ndecision trees and examine the closely related Minimum Description Length prin- \\nciple. A basic familiarity with Bayesian methods is important to understanding \\nU and characterizing the operation of many algorithms in machine learning. \\nFeatures of Bayesian learning methods include: \\n0 Each observed training example can incrementally decrease or increase the \\nestimated probability that a hypothesis is correct. This provides a more \\nflexible approach to learning than algorithms that completely eliminate a \\nhypothesis if it is found to be inconsistent with any single example. \\n0 Prior knowledge can be combined with observed data to determine the final \\nprobability ~f a hypothesis. In Bayesian learning, prior knowledge is pro- \\nvided by asserting (1) a prior probability for each candidate hypothesis, and \\n(2) a probability distribution over observed data for each possible hypothesis. \\nBayesian methods can accommodate hypotheses that make probabilistic pre- \\ndictions (e.g., hypotheses such as \"this pneumonia patient has a 93% chance \\nof complete recovery\"). \\n0 New instances can be classified by combining the predictions of multiple \\nhypotheses, weighted by their probabilities. \\n0 Even in cases where Bayesian methods prove computationally intractable, \\nthey can provide a standard of optimal decision making against which other \\npractical methods can be measured. \\nOne practical difficulty in applying Bayesian methods is that they typically \\nrequire initial knowledge of many probabilities. When these probabilities are not \\nknown in advance they are often estimated based on background knowledge, pre- \\nviously available data, and assumptions about the form of the underlying distribu- \\ntions. A second practical difficulty is the significant computational cost required to \\ndetermine the Bayes optimal hypothesis in the general case (linear in the number \\nof candidate hypotheses). In certain specialized situations, this computational cost \\ncan be significantly reduced.'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'macOS Version 11.2.3 (Build 20D91) Quartz PDFContext', 'creator': 'Preview', 'creationdate': \"D:20210312135113Z00'00'\", 'title': 'Machine - Learning - Tom Mitchell.pdf', 'moddate': \"D:20210312135113Z00'00'\", 'source': '..\\\\Data\\\\PDFiles\\\\MachineLearningTomMitchell.pdf', 'total_pages': 421, 'page': 167, 'page_label': '168'}, page_content='The remainder of this chapter is organized as follows. Section 6.2 intro- \\nduces Bayes theorem and defines maximum likelihood and maximum a posteriori \\nprobability hypotheses. The four subsequent sections then apply this probabilistic \\nframework to analyze several issues and learning algorithms discussed in earlier \\nchapters. For example, we show that several previously described algorithms out- \\nput maximum likelihood hypotheses, under certain assumptions. The remaining \\nsections then introduce a number of learning algorithms that explicitly manip- \\nulate probabilities. These include the Bayes optimal classifier, Gibbs algorithm, \\nand naive Bayes classifier. Finally, we discuss Bayesian belief networks, a rela- \\ntively recent approach to learning based on probabilistic reasoning, and the EM \\nalgorithm, a widely used algorithm for learning in the presence of unobserved \\nvariables. \\n6.2 BAYES THEOREM \\nIn machine learning we are often interested in determining the best hypothesis \\nfrom some space H, given the observed training data D. One way to specify \\nwhat we mean by the best hypothesis is to say that we demand the most probable \\nhypothesis, given the data D plus any initial knowledge about the prior probabil- \\nities of the various hypotheses in H. Bayes theorem provides a direct method for \\ncalculating such probabilities. More precisely, Bayes theorem provides a way to \\ncalculate the probability of a hypothesis based on its prior probability, the proba- \\nbilities of observing various data given the hypothesis, and the observed data itself. \\nTo define Bayes theorem precisely, let us first introduce a little notation. We \\nshall write P(h) to denote the initial probability that hypothesis h holds, before we \\nhave observed the training data. P(h) is often called the priorprobability of h and \\nmay reflect any background knowledge we have about the chance that h is a correct \\nhypothesis. If we have no such prior knowledge, then we might simply assign \\nthe same prior probability to each candidate hypothesis. Similarly, we will write \\nP(D) to denote the prior probability that training data D will be observed (i.e., \\nthe probability of D given no knowledge about which hypothesis holds). Next, \\nwe will write P(D1h) to denote the probability of observing data D given some \\nworld in which hypothesis h holds. More generally, we write P(xly) to denote \\nthe probability of x given y. In machine learning problems we are interested in \\nthe probability P (h 1 D) that h holds given the observed training data D. P (h 1 D) is \\ncalled the posteriorprobability of h, because it reflects our confidence that h holds \\nafter we have seen the training data D. Notice the posterior probability P(h1D) \\nreflects the influence of the training data D, in contrast to the prior probability \\nP(h) , which is independent of D. \\nBayes theorem is the cornerstone of Bayesian learning methods because \\nit provides a way to calculate the posterior probability P(hlD), from the prior \\nprobability P(h), together with P(D) and P(D(h). \\nBayes theorem:'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'macOS Version 11.2.3 (Build 20D91) Quartz PDFContext', 'creator': 'Preview', 'creationdate': \"D:20210312135113Z00'00'\", 'title': 'Machine - Learning - Tom Mitchell.pdf', 'moddate': \"D:20210312135113Z00'00'\", 'source': '..\\\\Data\\\\PDFiles\\\\MachineLearningTomMitchell.pdf', 'total_pages': 421, 'page': 168, 'page_label': '169'}, page_content='CHAPTER 6 BAYESIAN LEARNING 157 \\nAs one might intuitively expect, P(h ID) increases with P(h) and with P(D1h) \\naccording to Bayes theorem. It is also reasonable to see that P(hl D) decreases as \\nP(D) increases, because the more probable it is that D will be observed indepen- \\ndent of h, the less evidence D provides in support of h. \\nIn many learning scenarios, the learner considers some set of candidate \\nhypotheses H and is interested in finding the most probable hypothesis h E H \\ngiven the observed data D (or at least one of the maximally probable if there \\nare several). Any such maximally probable hypothesis is called a maximum a \\nposteriori (MAP) hypothesis. We can determine the MAP hypotheses by using \\nBayes theorem to calculate the posterior probability of each candidate hypothesis. \\nMore precisely, we will say that  MAP is a MAP hypothesis provided \\nh~~p = argmax P(hlD) \\nh€ H \\n= argmax P(D 1 h) P (h) \\nh€ H \\n(6.2) \\nNotice in the final step above we dropped the term P(D) because it is a constant \\nindependent of h. \\nIn some cases, we will assume that every hypothesis in H is equally probable \\na priori (P(hi) = P(h;) for all hi and h; in H). In this case we can further \\nsimplify Equation (6.2) and need only consider the term P(D1h) to find the most \\nprobable hypothesis. P(Dlh) is often called the likelihood of the data D given h, \\nand any hypothesis that maximizes P(Dlh) is called a maximum likelihood (ML) \\nhypothesis, hML. \\nhML = argmax P(Dlh) \\nh€ H \\nIn order to make clear the connection to machine learning problems, we \\nintroduced Bayes theorem above by referring to the data D as training examples of \\nsome target function and referring to H as the space of candidate target functions. \\nIn fact, Bayes theorem is much more general than suggested by this discussion. It \\ncan be applied equally well to any set H of mutually exclusive propositions whose \\nprobabilities sum to one (e.g., \"the sky is blue,\" and \"the sky is not blue\"). In this \\nchapter, we will at times consider cases where H is a hypothesis space containing \\npossible target functions and the data D are training examples. At other times we \\nwill consider cases where H is some other set of mutually exclusive propositions, \\nand D is some other kind of data. \\n6.2.1 An Example \\nTo illustrate Bayes rule, consider a medical diagnosis problem in which there are \\ntwo alternative hypotheses: (1) that the patien; has a- articular form of cancer. \\nand (2) that the patient does not.

We have prior \\nknowledge that over the entire population of people only .008 have this disease. \\nFurthermore, the lab test is only an imperfect indicator of the disease. The test \\nreturns a correct positive result in only 98% of the cases in which the disease is \\nactually present and a correct negative result in only 97% of the cases in which \\nthe disease is not present. In other cases, the test returns the opposite result. The \\nabove situation can be summarized by the following probabilities: \\nSuppose we now observe a new patient for whom the lab test returns a positive \\nresult. Should we diagnose the patient as having cancer or not? The maximum a \\nposteriori hypothesis can be found using Equation (6.2): \\nThus, h~~p = -cancer. The exact posterior hobabilities can also be determined \\nby normalizing the above quantities so that they sum to 1 (e.g., P(cancer($) = \\n.00;~~298 = .21). This step is warranted because Bayes theorem states that the \\nposterior probabilities are just the above quantities divided by the probability of \\nthe data, P(@). Although P($) was not provided directly as part of the problem \\nstatement, we can calculate it in this fashion because we know that P(cancerl$) \\nand P(-cancerl$) must sum to 1 (i.e., either the patient has cancer or they do \\nnot). Notice that while the posterior probability of cancer is significantly higher \\nthan its prior probability, the most probable hypothesis is still that the patient does \\nnot have cancer. \\nAs this example illustrates, the result of Bayesian inference depends strongly \\non the prior probabilities, which must be available in order to apply the method \\ndirectly.

(xm, dm)) where xi is some instance from X and where di is the target \\nvalue of xi (i.e., di = c(xi)). To simplify the discussion in this section, we assume \\nthe sequence of instances (xl . . . xm) is held fixed, so that the training data D can \\nbe written simply as the sequence of target values D = (dl . . . dm). It can be shown \\n(see Exercise 6.4) that this simplification does not alter the main conclusions of \\nthis section. \\nWe can design a straightforward concept learning algorithm to output the \\nmaximum a posteriori hypothesis, based on Bayes theorem, as follows: \\nBRUTE-FORCE MAP LEARNING algorithm \\n1.

Because FIND-S outputs a consistent hy- \\npothesis, we know that it will output a MAP hypothesis under the probability \\ndistributions P(h) and P(D1h) defined above.

By identifying \\nprobability distributions P(h) and P(Dlh) under which the algorithm outputs \\noptimal (i.e., MAP) hypotheses, we can characterize the implicit assumptions \\n, under which this algorithm behaves optimally. \\n( Using the Bayesian perspective to characterize learning algorithms in this \\nway is similar in spirit to characterizing the inductive bias of the learner. Recall \\nthat in Chapter 2 we defined the inductive bias of a learning algorithm to be \\nthe set of assumptions B sufficient to deductively justify the inductive inference \\nperformed by the learner. For example, we described the inductive bias of the \\nCANDIDATE-ELIMINATION algorithm as the assumption that the target concept c is \\nincluded in the hypothesis space H. Furthermore, we showed there that the output \\nof this learning algorithm follows deductively from its inputs plus this implicit \\ninductive bias assumption. The above Bayesian interpretation provides an alter- \\nnative way to characterize the assumptions implicit in learning algorithms. Here, \\ninstead of modeling the inductive inference method by an equivalent deductive \\nsystem, we model it by an equivalent probabilistic reasoning system based on \\nBayes theorem. And here the implicit assumptions that we attribute to the learner \\nare assumptions of the form \"the prior probabilities over H are given by the \\ndistribution P(h), and the strength of data in rejecting or accepting a hypothesis \\nis given by P(Dlh).\" The definitions of P(h) and P(D(h) given in this section \\ncharacterize the implicit assumptions of the CANDIDATE-ELIMINATION and FIND-S \\nalgorithms. A probabilistic reasoning system based on Bayes theorem will exhibit \\ninput-output behavior equivalent to these algorithms, provided it is given these \\nassumed probability distributions. \\nThe discussion throughout this section corresponds to a special case of \\nBayesian reasoning, because we considered the case where P(D1h) takes on val- \\nues of only 0 and 1, reflecting the deterministic predictions of hypotheses and the \\nassumption of noise-free training data.

Learner L considers an instance \\nspace X and a hypothesis space H consisting of some class of real-valued functions \\ndefined over X (i.e., each h in H is a function of the form h : X -+ 8, where \\n8 represents the set of real numbers). The problem faced by L is to learn an \\nunknown target function f : X -+ 8 drawn from H. A set of m training examples \\nis provided, where the target value of each example is corrupted by random \\nnoise drawn according to a Normal probability distribution.

Here f (xi) is \\nthe noise-free value of the target function and ei is a random variable represent- \\ning the noise.

The \\ntask of the learner is to output a maximum likelihood hypothesis, or, equivalently, \\na MAP hypothesis assuming all hypotheses are equally probable a priori. \\nA simple example of such a problem is learning a linear function, though our \\nanalysis applies to learning arbitrary real-valued functions.

First, in order to discuss probabilities over continuous variables such as e, \\nwe must introduce probability densities. The reason, roughly, is that we wish for \\nthe total probability over all possible values of the random variable to sum to one. \\nIn the case of continuous variables we cannot achieve this by assigning a finite \\nprobability to each of the infinite set of possible values for the random variable. \\nInstead, we speak of a probability density for continuous variables such as e and \\nrequire that the integral of this probability density over all possible values be one. \\nIn general we will use lower case p to refer to the probability density function, \\nto distinguish it from a finite probability P (which we will sometimes refer to as \\na probability mass). The probability density p(x0) is the limit as E goes to zero, \\nof times the probability that x will take on a value in the interval [xo, xo + 6). \\nProbability density function: \\nSecond, we stated that the random noise variable e is generated by a Normal \\nprobability distribution. A Normal distribution is a smooth, bell-shaped distribu- \\ntion that can be completely characterized by its mean p and its standard deviation \\na. See Table 5.4 for a precise definition. \\nGiven this background we now return to the main issue: showing that the \\nleast-squared error hypothesis is, in fact, the maximum likelihood hypothesis \\nwithin our problem setting.

A second reason is that the smooth, bell-shaped distribution is a \\ngood approximation to many types of noise in physical systems.

Of course, in \\nreality, different components that contribute to noise might not follow identical \\ndistributions, in which case this theorem will not necessarily justify our choice. \\nMinimizing the sum of squared errors is a common approach in many neural \\nnetwork, curve fitting, and other approaches to approximating real-valued func- \\ntions. Chapter 4 describes gradient descent methods that seek the least-squared \\nerror hypothesis in neural network learning. \\nBefore leaving our discussion of the relationship between the maximum \\nlikelihood hypothesis and the least-squared error hypothesis, it is important to \\nnote some limitations of this problem setting. The above analysis considers noise \\nonly in the target value of the training example and does not consider noise in \\nthe attributes describing the instances themselves. For example, if the problem \\nis to learn to predict the weight of someone based on that person's age and \\nheight, then the above analysis assumes noise in measurements of weight, but \\nperfect measurements of age and height. The analysis becomes significantly more \\ncomplex as these simplifying assumptions are removed. \\n6.5 MAXIMUM LIKELIHOOD HYPOTHESES FOR PREDICTING \\nPROBABILITIES \\nIn the problem setting of the previous section we determined that the maximum \\nlikelihood hypothesis is the one that minimizes the sum of squared errors over the \\ntraining examples.

Viewed in this light, it provides one method for dealing with \\nthe issue of overjitting the data. \\nQuinlan and Rivest (1989) describe experiments applying the MDL principle \\nto choose the best size for a decision tree.

More precisely, the ex- \\npected value is taken over target concepts drawn at random according to the prior \\nprobability distribution assumed by the learner. Under this condition, the expected \\nvalue of the error of the Gibbs algorithm is at worst twice the expected value of \\nthe error of the Bayes optimal classifier. \\nThis result has an interesting implication for the concept learning problem \\ndescribed earlier.

In some domains its performance has been shown \\nto be comparable to that of neural network and decision tree learning. This section \\nintroduces the naive Bayes classifier; the next section applies it to the practical \\nproblem of learning to classify natural language text documents. \\nThe naive Bayes classifier applies to learning tasks where each instance x \\nis described by a conjunction of attribute values and where the target function \\nf (x) can take on any value from some finite set V. A set of training examples of \\nthe target function is provided, and a new instance is presented, described by the \\ntuple of attribute values (al, a2.. .a,). The learner is asked to predict the target \\nvalue, or classification, for this new instance. \\nThe Bayesian approach to classifying the new instance is to assign the most \\nprobable target value, VMAP, given the attribute values (al, a2 . . . a,) that describe \\nthe instance. \\nVMAP = argmax P(vjlal, a2. . . a,) \\nvj€ v \\nWe can use Bayes theorem to rewrite this expression as \\nNow we could attempt to estimate the two terms in Equation (6.19) based on \\nthe training data.

However, \\nestimating the different P(al, a2.. . a,lvj) terms in this fashion is not feasible \\nunless we have a very, very large set of training data. The problem is that the \\nnumber of these terms is equal to the number of possible instances times the \\nnumber of possible target values. Therefore, we need to see every instance in \\nthe instance space many times in order to obtain reliable estimates. \\nThe naive Bayes classifier is based on the simplifying assumption that the \\nattribute values are conditionally independent given the target value. In other \\nwords, the assumption is that given the target value of the instance, the probability \\nof observing the conjunction al, a2.. .a, is just the product of the probabilities \\nfor the individual attributes: P(a1, a2 . . . a, 1 vj) = ni P(ai lvj).

The set of these estimates corresponds to the learned \\nhypothesis. This hypothesis is then used to classify each new instance by applying \\nthe rule in Equation (6.20). Whenever the naive Bayes assumption of conditional \\nindependence is satisfied, this naive Bayes classification VNB is identical to the \\nMAP classification. \\nOne interesting difference between the naive Bayes learning method and \\nother learning methods we have considered is that there is no explicit search \\nthrough the space of possible hypotheses (in this case, the space of possible \\nhypotheses is the space of possible values that can be assigned to the various P(vj) \\nand P(ailvj) terms). Instead, the hypothesis is formed without searching, simply by \\ncounting the frequency of various data combinations within the training examples. \\n6.9.1 An Illustrative Example \\nLet us apply the naive Bayes classifier to a concept learning problem we consid- \\nered during our discussion of decision tree learning: classifying days according \\nto whether someone will play tennis.

For the current example, this probability is ,02$ym,, = -795. \\n6.9.1.1 ESTIMATING PROBABILITIES \\nUp to this point we have estimated probabilities by the fraction of times the event \\nis observed to occur over the total number of opportunities.

This raises two difficulties. First, $ pro- \\nduces a biased underestimate of the probability. Second, when this probability es- \\ntimate is zero, this probability term will dominate the Bayes classifier if the future \\nquery contains Wind = strong.

For example, we might \\nwish to learn the target concept \"electronic news articles that I find interesting,\" \\nor \"pages on the World Wide Web that discuss machine learning topics.\" In both \\ncases, if a computer could learn the target concept accurately, it could automat- \\nically filter the large volume of online text documents to present only the most \\nrelevant documents to the user. \\nWe present here a general algorithm for learning to classify text, based \\non the naive Bayes classifier. Interestingly, probabilistic approaches such as the \\none described here are among the most effective algorithms currently known for \\nlearning to classify text documents. Examples of such systems are described by \\nLewis (1991), Lang (1995), and Joachims (1996). \\nThe naive Bayes algorithm that we shall present applies in the following \\ngeneral setting. Consider an instance space X consisting of all possible text docu- \\nments (i.e., all possible strings of words and punctuation of all possible lengths). \\nWe are given training examples of some unknown target function f (x), which \\ncan take on any value from some finite set V. The task is to learn from these \\ntraining examples to predict the target value for subsequent text documents. For \\nillustration, we will consider the target function classifying documents as interest- \\ning or uninteresting to a particular person, using the target values like and dislike \\nto indicate these two classes. \\nThe two main design issues involved in applying the naive Bayes classifier \\nto such rext classification problems are first to decide how to represent an arbitrary \\ntext document in terms of attribute values, and second to decide how to estimate \\nthe probabilities required by the naive Bayes classifier. \\nOur approach to representing arbitrary text documents is disturbingly simple: \\nGiven a text document, such as this paragraph, we define an attribute for each word \\nposition in the document and define the value of that attribute to be the English \\nword found in that position. Thus, the current paragraph would be described by \\n11 1 attribute values, corresponding to the 11 1 word positions. The value of the \\nfirst attribute is the word \"our,\" the value of the second attribute is the word \\n\"approach,\" and so on. Notice that long text documents will require a larger \\nnumber of attributes than short documents. As we shall see, this will not cause \\nus any trouble.'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'macOS Version 11.2.3 (Build 20D91) Quartz PDFContext', 'creator': 'Preview', 'creationdate': \"D:20210312135113Z00'00'\", 'title': 'Machine - Learning - Tom Mitchell.pdf', 'moddate': \"D:20210312135113Z00'00'\", 'source': '..\\\\Data\\\\PDFiles\\\\MachineLearningTomMitchell.pdf', 'total_pages': 421, 'page': 192, 'page_label': '193'}, page_content='CHAPTER 6 BAYESIAN LEARNING 181 \\nGiven this representation for text documents, we can now apply the naive \\nBayes classifier.

We are now given a new document and asked to classify \\nit. Again, for concreteness let us assume the new text document is the preceding \\nparagraph.

The inde- \\nF pendence assumption P(al, . . . alll lvj) = nfL1 P(ai lvj) states in this setting that \\nthe word probabilities for one text position are independent of the words that oc- \\ncur in other positions, given the document classification vj. Note this assumption \\nis clearly incorrect. For example, the probability of observing the word \"learning\" \\nin some position may be greater if the preceding word is \"machine.\" Despite the \\nobvious inaccuracy of this independence assumption, we have little choice but to \\nmake it-without it, the number of probability terms that must be computed is \\nprohibitive. Fortunately, in practice the naive Bayes learner performs remarkably \\nwell in many text classification problems despite the incorrectness of this indepen- \\ndence assumption. Dorningos and Pazzani (1996) provide an interesting analysis \\nof this fortunate phenomenon. \\nTo calculate VNB using the above expression, we require estimates for the \\nprobability terms P(vj) and P(ai = wklvj) (here we introduce wk to indicate the kth \\nword in the English vocabulary). The first of these can easily be estimated based \\non the fraction of each class in the training data (P(1ike) = .3 and P(dis1ike) = .7 \\nin the current example). As usual, estimating the class conditional probabilities \\n(e.g., P(al = \"our\"ldis1ike)) is more problematic because we must estimate one \\nsuch probability term for each combination of text position, English word, and \\ntarget value. Unfortunately, there are approximately 50,000 distinct words in the \\nEnglish vocabulary, 2 possible target values, and 11 1 text positions in the current \\nexample, so we must estimate 2. 11 1 -50,000 = 10 million such terms from the \\ntraining data. \\nFortunately, we can make an additional reasonable assumption that reduces \\nthe number of probabilities that must be estimated. In particular, we shall as- \\nsume the probability of encountering a specific word wk (e.g., \"chocolate\") is \\nindependent of the specific word position being considered (e.g., a23 versus agg). \\nMore formally, this amounts to assuming that the attributes are independent and \\nidentically distributed, given the target classification; that is, P(ai = wk)vj) ='), Document(metadata={'producer': 'macOS Version 11.2.3 (Build 20D91) Quartz PDFContext', 'creator': 'Preview', 'creationdate': \"D:20210312135113Z00'00'\", 'title': 'Machine - Learning - Tom Mitchell.pdf', 'moddate': \"D:20210312135113Z00'00'\", 'source': '..\\\\Data\\\\PDFiles\\\\MachineLearningTomMitchell.pdf', 'total_pages': 421, 'page': 193, 'page_label': '194'}, page_content='P(a, = wkJvj) for all i, j, k, m.

This assumption dramatically reduces \\nthe complexity of learning the target function. When it is met, the naive Bayes \\nclassifier outputs the optimal Bayes classification. However, in many cases this \\nconditional independence assumption is clearly overly restrictive. \\nA Bayesian belief network describes the probability distribution governing a \\nset of variables by specifying a set of conditional independence assumptions along \\nwith a set of conditional probabilities. In contrast to the naive Bayes classifier, \\nwhich assumes that all the variables are conditionally independent given the value \\nof the target variable, Bayesian belief networks allow stating conditional indepen- \\ndence assumptions that apply to subsets of the variables. Thus, Bayesian belief \\nnetworks provide an intermediate approach that is less constraining than the global \\nassumption of conditional independence made by the naive Bayes classifier, but \\nmore tractable than avoiding conditional independence assumptions altogether. \\nBayesian belief networks are an active focus of current research, and a variety of \\nalgorithms have been proposed for learning them and for using them for inference.'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'macOS Version 11.2.3 (Build 20D91) Quartz PDFContext', 'creator': 'Preview', 'creationdate': \"D:20210312135113Z00'00'\", 'title': 'Machine - Learning - Tom Mitchell.pdf', 'moddate': \"D:20210312135113Z00'00'\", 'source': '..\\\\Data\\\\PDFiles\\\\MachineLearningTomMitchell.pdf', 'total_pages': 421, 'page': 196, 'page_label': '197'}, page_content=\"CHAPTER 6 BAYESIAN LEARNING 185 \\nIn this section we introduce the key concepts and the representation of Bayesian \\nbelief networks. More detailed treatments are given by Pearl (1988), Russell and \\nNorvig (1995), Heckerman et al. (1995), and Jensen (1996). \\nIn general, a Bayesian belief network describes the probability distribution \\nover a set of variables. Consider an arbitrary set of random variables Yl . . . Y,, \\nwhere each variable Yi can take on the set of possible values V(Yi). We define \\nthe joint space of the set of variables Y to be the cross product V(Yl) x V(Y2) x \\n. . . V(Y,). In other words, each item in the joint space corresponds to one of the \\npossible assignments of values to the tuple of variables (Yl . . . Y,). The probability \\ndistribution over this joint' space is called the joint probability distribution. The \\njoint probability distribution specifies the probability for each of the possible \\nvariable bindings for the tuple (Yl . . . Y,). A Bayesian belief network describes \\nthe joint probability distribution for a set of variables. \\n6.11.1 Conditional Independence \\ni Let us begin our discussion of Bayesian belief networks by defining precisely \\nthe notion of conditional independence. Let X, Y, and Z be three discrete-valued \\nrandom variables. We say that X is conditionally independent of Y given Z if \\nthe probability distribution governing X is independent of the value of Y given a \\nvalue for 2; that is, if \\nwhere xi E V(X), yj E V(Y), and zk E V(Z). We commonly write the above \\nexpression in abbreviated form as P(XIY, Z) = P(X1Z). This definition of con- \\nditional independence can be extended to sets of variables as well. We say that \\nthe set of variables X1 . . . Xi is conditionally independent of the set of variables \\nYl . . . Ym given the set of variables 21 . . . Z, if \\nP(X1 ... XIJY1 ... Ym, z1 ... Z,) = P(Xl ... X1]Z1 ... Z,) \\nNote the correspondence between this definition and our use of conditional , \\nindependence in the definition of the naive Bayes classifier. The naive Bayes \\nclassifier assumes that the instance attribute A1 is conditionally independent of \\ninstance attribute A2 given the target value V. This allows the naive Bayes clas- \\nsifier to calculate P(Al, A21V) in Equation (6.20) as follows \\nEquation (6.23) is just the general form of the product rule of probability from \\nTable 6.1. Equation (6.24) follows because if A1 is conditionally independent of \\nA2 given V, then by our definition of conditional independence P (A1 IA2, V) = \\nP(A1IV).\"), Document(metadata={'producer': 'macOS Version 11.2.3 (Build 20D91) Quartz PDFContext', 'creator': 'Preview', 'creationdate': \"D:20210312135113Z00'00'\", 'title': 'Machine - Learning - Tom Mitchell.pdf', 'moddate': \"D:20210312135113Z00'00'\", 'source': '..\\\\Data\\\\PDFiles\\\\MachineLearningTomMitchell.pdf', 'total_pages': 421, 'page': 197, 'page_label': '198'}, page_content='S,B S,-B 7S.B 1s.-B \\n-C 0.6 0.9 0.2 \\nCampfire \\nFIGURE 6.3 \\nA Bayesian belief network.

For example, the Bayesian network in \\nFigure 6.3 represents the joint probability distribution over the boolean variables \\nStorm, Lightning, Thunder, ForestFire, Campjre, and BusTourGroup. In general, \\na Bayesian network represents the joint probability distribution by specifying a \\nset of conditional independence assumptions (represented by a directed acyclic \\ngraph), together with sets of local conditional probabilities. Each variable in the \\njoint space is represented by a node in the Bayesian network. For each variable two \\ntypes of information are specified. First, the network arcs represent the assertion \\nthat the variable is conditionally independent of its nondescendants in the network \\ngiven its immediate predecessors in the network. We say Xjis a descendant of \\n, Y if there is a directed path from Y to X. Second, a conditional probability table \\nis given for each variable, describing the probability distribution for that variable \\ngiven the values of its immediate predecessors. The joint probability for any de- \\nsired assignment of values (yl, . . . , y,) to the tuple of network variables (YI . . . Y,) \\ncan be computed by the formula \\nn \\n~(YI,. . . , yd = np(yi~parents(~i)) \\ni=l \\nwhere Parents(Yi) denotes the set of immediate predecessors of Yi in the net- \\nwork. Note the values of P(yiJ Parents(Yi)) are precisely the values stored in the \\nconditional probability table associated with node Yi. \\nTo illustrate, the Bayesian network in Figure 6.3 represents the joint prob- \\nability distribution over the boolean variables Storm, Lightning, Thunder, Forest-'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'macOS Version 11.2.3 (Build 20D91) Quartz PDFContext', 'creator': 'Preview', 'creationdate': \"D:20210312135113Z00'00'\", 'title': 'Machine - Learning - Tom Mitchell.pdf', 'moddate': \"D:20210312135113Z00'00'\", 'source': '..\\\\Data\\\\PDFiles\\\\MachineLearningTomMitchell.pdf', 'total_pages': 421, 'page': 198, 'page_label': '199'}, page_content='CHmR 6 BAYESIAN LEARNING 187 \\nFire, Campfire, and BusTourGroup. Consider the node Campjire. The network \\nnodes and arcs represent the assertion that CampJire is conditionally indepen- \\ndent of its nondescendants Lightning and Thunder, given its immediate parents \\nStorm and BusTourGroup. This means that once we know the value of the vari- \\nables Storm and BusTourGroup, the variables Lightning and Thunder provide no \\nadditional information about Campfire. The right side of the figure shows the \\nconditional probability table associated with the variable Campfire. The top left \\nentry in this table, for example, expresses the assertion that \\nP(Campfire = TruelStorm = True, BusTourGroup = True) = 0.4 \\nNote this table provides only the conditional probabilities of Campjire given its \\nparent variables Storm and BusTourGroup. The set of local conditional probability \\ntables for all the variables, together with the set of conditional independence as- \\nsumptions described by the network, describe the full joint probability distribution \\nfor the network. \\nOne attractive feature of Bayesian belief networks is that they allow a con- \\nvenient way to represent causal knowledge such as the fact that Lightning causes \\nThunder. In the terminology of conditional independence, we express this by stat- \\ning that Thunder is conditionally independent of other variables in the network, \\ngiven the value of Lightning. Note this conditional independence assumption is \\nimplied by the arcs in the Bayesian network of Figure 6.3. \\n6.11.3 Inference \\nWe might wish to use a Bayesian network to infer the value of some target \\nvariable (e.g., ForestFire) given the observed values of the other variables. Of \\ncourse, given that we are dealing with random variables it will not generally be \\ncorrect to assign the target variable a single determined value. What we really \\nwish to infer is the probability distribution for the target variable, which specifies \\nthe probability that it will take on each of its possible values given the observed \\nvalues of the other variables. This inference step can be straightforward if values \\nfor all of the other variables in the network are known exactly. In the more \\ngeneral case we may wish to infer the probability distribution for some variable \\n(e.g., ForestFire) given observed values for only a subset of the other variables \\n(e.g., Thunder and BusTourGroup may be the only observed values available). In \\ngeneral, a Bayesian network can be used to compute the probability distribution \\nfor any subset of network variables given the values or distributions for any subset \\nof the remaining variables. \\nExact inference of probabilities in general for an arbitrary Bayesian net- \\nwork is known to be NP-hard (Cooper 1990). Numerous methods have been \\nproposed for probabilistic inference in Bayesian networks, including exact infer- \\nence methods and approximate inference methods that sacrifice precision to gain \\nefficiency.

This question is a focus of much current research. Several different \\nsettings for this learning problem can be considered. First, the network structure \\nmight be given in advance, or it might have to be inferred from the training data. \\nSecond, all the network variables might be directly observable in each training \\nexample, or some might be unobservable. \\nIn the case where the network structure is given in advance and the variables \\nare fully observable in the training examples, learning the conditional probability \\ntables is straightforward. We simply estimate the conditional probability table \\nentries just as we would for a naive Bayes classifier. \\nIn the case where the network structure is given but only some of the variable \\nvalues are observable in the training data, the learning problem is more difficult. \\nThis problem is somewhat analogous to learning the weights for the hidden units in \\nan artificial neural network, where the input and output node values are given but \\nthe hidden unit values are left unspecified by the training examples. In fact, Russell \\net al. (1995) propose a similar gradient ascent procedure that learns the entries in \\nthe conditional probability tables. This gradient ascent procedure searches through \\na space of hypotheses that corresponds to the set of all possible entries for the \\nconditional probability tables. The objective function that is maximized during \\ngradient ascent is the probability P(D1h) of the observed training data D given \\nthe hypothesis h. By definition, this corresponds to searching for the maximum \\nlikelihood hypothesis for the table entries. \\n6.11.5 Gradient Ascent Training of Bayesian Networks \\nThe gradient ascent rule given by Russell et al. (1995) maximizes P(D1h) by \\nfollowing the gradient of In P(D Ih) with respect to the parameters that define the \\nconditional probability tables of the Bayesian network. Let wi;k denote a single \\nentry in one of the conditional probability tables. In particular, let wijk denote \\nthe conditional probability that the network variable Yi will take on the value yi, \\ngiven that its immediate parents Ui take on the values given by uik. For example, \\nif wijk is the top right entry in the conditional probability table in Figure 6.3, then \\nYi is the variable Campjire, Ui is the tuple of its parents (Stomz, BusTourGroup), \\nyij = True, and uik = (False, False). The gradient of In P(D1h) is given by \\nthe derivatives for each of the toijk.

For example, in training or using the Bayesian belief network \\nof Figure 6.3, we might have data where only a subset of the network variables \\nStorm, Lightning, Thunder, ForestFire, Campfire, and BusTourGroup have been \\nobserved. Many approaches have been proposed to handle the problem of learning \\nin the presence of unobserved variables. As we saw in Chapter 3, if some variable \\n/ is sometimes observed and sometimes not, then we can use the cases for which \\nit has been observed to learn to predict its values when it is not. In this section \\nwe describe the EM algorithm (Dempster et al. 1977), a widely used approach \\nto learning in the presence of unobserved variables. The EM algorithm can be \\nused even for variables whose value is never directly observed, provided the \\ngeneral form of the probability distribution governing these variables is known. \\nThe EM algorithm has been used to train Bayesian belief networks (see Heckerman \\n1995) as well as radial basis function networks discussed in Section 8.4. The EM \\nalgorithm is also the basis for many unsupervised clustering algorithms (e.g., \\nCheeseman et al. 1988), and it is the basis for the widely used Baum-Welch \\nforward-backward algorithm for learning Partially Observable Markov Models \\n(Rabiner 1989). \\n6.12.1 Estimating Means of k Gaussians \\nThe easiest way to introduce the EM algorithm is via an example. Consider a \\nproblem in which the data D is a set of instances generated by a probability \\ndistribution that is a mixture of k distinct Normal distributions. This problem \\nsetting is illustrated in Figure 6.4 for the case where k = 2 and where the instances \\nare the points shown along the x axis. Each instance is generated using a two-step \\nprocess. First, one of the k Normal distributions is selected at random. Second, \\na single random instance xi is generated according to this selected distribution. \\nThis process is repeated to generate a set of data points as shown in the figure.

More generally, the EM algorithm can be applied \\nin many settings where we wish to estimate some set of parameters 8 that describe \\nan underlying probability distribution, given only the observed portion of the full \\ndata produced by this distribution. In the above two-means example the parameters \\nof interest were 8 = (PI, p2), and the full data were the triples (xi, zil, zi2) of \\nwhich only the xi were observed. In general let X = {xl, . . . , x,} denote the \\nobserved data in a set of m independently drawn instances, let Z = {zl, . . . , z,} \\ndenote the unobserved data in these same instances, and let Y = X U Z denote \\nthe full data. Note the unobserved Z can be treated as a random variable whose \\nprobability distribution depends on the unknown parameters 8 and on the observed \\ndata X. Similarly, Y is a random variable because it is defined in terms of the \\nrandom variable Z. In the remainder of this section we describe the general form \\nof the EM algorithm. We use h to denote the current hypothesized values of the \\nparameters 8, and h' to denote the revised hypothesis that is estimated on each \\niteration of the EM algorithm. \\nThe EM algorithm searches for the maximum likelihood hypothesis h' by \\nseeking the h' that maximizes E[ln P(Y (h')]. This expected value is taken over \\nthe probability distribution governing Y, which is determined by the unknown \\nparameters 8. Let us consider exactly what this expression signifies. First, P(Ylhl) \\nis the likelihood of the full data Y given hypothesis h'. It is reasonable that we wish \\nto find a h' that maximizes some function of this quantity. Second, maximizing \\nthe logarithm of this quantity In P(Ylhl) also maximizes P(Ylhl), as we have \\ndiscussed on several occasions already. Third, we introduce the expected value \\nE[ln P(Ylhl)] because the full data Y is itself a random variable. Given that \\nthe full data Y is a combination of the observed data X and unobserved data \\nZ, we must average over the possible values of the unobserved Z, weighting \\neach according to its probability. In other words we take the expected value \\nE[ln P(Y lh')] over the probability distribution governing the random variable Y. \\nThe distribution governing Y is determined by the completely known values for \\nX, plus the distribution governing Z. \\nWhat is the probability distribution governing Y? In general we will not \\nknow this distribution because it is determined by the parameters 0 that we are \\ntrying to estimate. Therefore, the EM algorithm uses its current hypothesis h in \\nplace of the actual parameters 8 to estimate the distribution governing Y. Let us \\ndefine a function Q(hllh) that gives E[ln P(Y lh')] as a function of h', under the \\nassumption that 8 = h and given the observed portion X of the full data Y. \\nWe write this function Q in the form Q(hllh) to indicate that it is defined in part \\nby the assumption that the current hypothesis h is equal to 8.

Bayesian methods allow assigning a posterior probability to \\neach candidate hypothesis, based on these assumed priors and the observed \\ndata. \\n0 Bayesian methods can be used to determine the most probable hypothesis \\ngiven the data-the maximum a posteriori (MAP) hypothesis. This is the \\noptimal hypothesis in the sense that no other hypothesis is more likely. \\n0 The Bayes optimal classifier combines the predictions of all alternative hy- \\npotheses, weighted by their posterior probabilities, to calculate the most \\nprobable classification of each new instance. \\ni 0 The naive Bayes classifier is a Bayesian learning method that has been found \\nto be useful in many practical applications. It is called \"naive\" because it in- \\ncorporates the simplifying assumption that attribute values are conditionally \\nindependent, given the classification of the instance. When this assumption \\nis met, the naive Bayes classifier outputs the MAP classification. Even when \\nthis assumption is not met, as in the case of learning to classify text, the \\nnaive Bayes classifier is often quite effective. Bayesian belief networks pro- \\nvide a more expressive representation for sets of conditional independence \\nassumptions among subsets of the attributes. \\n0 The framework of Bayesian reasoning can provide a useful basis for ana- \\nlyzing certain learning methods that do not directly apply Bayes theorem. \\nFor example, under certain conditions it can be shown that minimizing the \\nsquared error when learning a real-valued target function corresponds to \\ncomputing the maximum likelihood hypothesis. \\n0 The Minimum Description Length principle recommends choosing the hy- \\npothesis that minimizes the description length of the hypothesis plus the \\ndescription length of the data given the hypothesis. Bayes theorem and ba- \\nsic results from information theory can be used to provide a rationale for \\nthis principle. \\n0 In many practical learning tasks, some of the relevant instance variables \\nmay be unobservable. The EM algorithm provides a quite general approach \\nto learning in the presence of unobservable variables. This algorithm be- \\ngins with an arbitrary initial hypothesis. It then repeatedly calculates the \\nexpected values of the hidden variables (assuming the current hypothesis \\nis correct), and then recalculates the maximum likelihood hypothesis (as- \\nsuming the hidden variables have the expected values calculated by the first \\nstep).

This chapter \\npresents key results from this theory, providing answers to these questions within \\nparticular problem settings. We focus here on the problem of inductively learning \\nan unknown target function, given only training examples of this target func- \\ntion and a space of candidate hypotheses. Within this setting, we will be chiefly \\nconcerned with questions such as how many training examples are sufficient to \\nsuccessfully learn the target function, and how many mistakes will the learner \\nmake before succeeding. As we shall see, it is possible to set quantitative bounds \\non these measures, depending on attributes of the learning problem such as: \\n0 the size or complexity of the hypothesis space considered by the learner \\n0 the accuracy to which the target concept must be approximated \\n0 the probability that the learner will output a successful hypothesis \\n0 the manner in which training examples are presented to the learner \\nFor the most part, we will focus not on individual learning algorithms, but \\nrather on broad classes of learning algorithms characterized by the hypothesis \\nspaces they consider, the presentation of training examples, etc. Our goal is to \\nanswer questions such as: \\n0 Sample complexity. How many training examples are needed for a learner \\nto converge (with high probability) to a successful hypothesis? \\n0 Computational complexity. How much computational effort is needed for a \\nlearner to converge (with high probability) to a successful hypothesis? \\n0 Mistake bound. How many training examples will the learner misclassify \\nbefore converging to a successful hypothesis? \\nNote there are many specific settings in which we could pursue such ques- \\ntions. For example, there are various ways to specify what it means for the learner \\nto be \"successful.\" We might specify that to succeed, the learner must output a \\nhypothesis identical to the target concept. Alternatively, we might simply require \\nthat it output a hypothesis that agrees with the target concept most of the time, or \\nthat it usually output such a hypothesis. Similarly, we must specify how training \\nexamples are to be obtained by the learner. We might specify that training ex- \\namples are presented by a helpful teacher, or obtained by the learner performing \\nexperiments, or simply generated at random according to some process outside \\nthe learner\\'s control. As we might expect, the answers to the above questions \\ndepend on the particular setting, or learning model, we have in mind. \\nThe remainder of this chapter is organized as follows.

We begin by specifying \\nthe problem setting that defines the PAC learning model, then consider the ques- \\ntions of how many training examples and how much computation are required \\nin order to learn various classes of target functions within this PAC model. For \\ni the sake of simplicity, we restrict the discussion to the case of learning boolean- \\nvalued concepts from noise-free training data. However, many of the results can \\nbe extended to the more general scenario of learning real-valued target functions \\n(see, for example, Natarajan 1991), and some can be extended to learning from \\ncertain types of noisy data (see, for example, Laird 1988; Kearns and Vazirani \\n1994). \\n7.2.1 The Problem Setting \\nAs in earlier chapters, let X refer to the set of all possible instances over which \\ntarget functions may be defined. For example, X might represent the set of all \\npeople, each described by the attributes age (e.g., young or old) and height (short \\nor tall). Let C refer to some set of target concepts that our learner might be called \\nupon to learn. Each target concept c in C corresponds to some subset of X, or \\nequivalently to some boolean-valued function c : X + {0, 1). For example, one \\ntarget concept c in C might be the concept \"people who are skiers.\" If x is a \\npositive example of c, then we will write c(x) = 1; if x is a negative example, \\nc(x) = 0. \\nWe assume instances are generated at random from X according to some \\nprobability distribution D. For example, 2) might be the distribution of instances \\ngenerated by observing people who walk out of the largest sports store in Switzer- \\nland. In general, D may be any distribution, and it will not generally be known \\nto the learner. All that we require of D is that it be stationary; that is, that the \\ndistribution not change over time. Training examples are generated by drawing \\nan instance x at random according to D, then presenting x along with its target \\nvalue, c(x), to the learner. \\nThe learner L considers some set H of possible hypotheses when attempting \\nto learn the target concept. For example, H might be the set of all hypotheses'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'macOS Version 11.2.3 (Build 20D91) Quartz PDFContext', 'creator': 'Preview', 'creationdate': \"D:20210312135113Z00'00'\", 'title': 'Machine - Learning - Tom Mitchell.pdf', 'moddate': \"D:20210312135113Z00'00'\", 'source': '..\\\\Data\\\\PDFiles\\\\MachineLearningTomMitchell.pdf', 'total_pages': 421, 'page': 215, 'page_label': '216'}, page_content=\"describable by conjunctions of the attributes age and height. After observing \\na sequence of training examples of the target concept c, L must output some \\nhypothesis h from H, which is its estimate of c. To be fair, we evaluate the \\nsuccess of L by the performance of h over new instances drawn randomly from \\nX according to D, the same probability distribution used to generate the training \\ndata. \\nWithin this setting, we are interested in characterizing the performance of \\nvarious learners L using various hypothesis spaces H, when learning individual \\ntarget concepts drawn from various classes C. Because we demand that L be \\ngeneral enough to learn any target concept from C regardless of the distribution \\nof training examples, we will often be interested in worst-case analyses over all \\npossible target concepts from C and all possible instance distributions D. \\n7.2.2 Error of a Hypothesis \\nBecause we are interested in how closely the learner's output hypothesis h ap- \\nproximates the actual target concept c, let us begin by defining the true error \\nof a hypothesis h with respect to target concept c and instance distribution D. \\nInformally, the true error of h is just the error rate we expect when applying h \\nto future instances drawn according to the probability distribution 27. In fact, we \\nalready defined the true error of h in Chapter 5. For convenience, we restate the \\ndefinition here using c to represent the boolean target function. \\nDefinition: The true error (denoted errorv(h)) of hypothesis h with respect to target \\nconcept c and distribution D is the probability that h will misclassify an instance \\ndrawn at random according to D. \\nHere the notation Pr indicates that the probability is taken over the instance \\nx€ D \\ndistribution V. \\nFigure 7.1 shows this definition of error in graphical form. The concepts c \\nand h are depicted by the sets of instances within X that they label as positive. The \\nerror of h with respect to c is the probability that a randomly drawn instance will \\nfall into the region where h and c disagree (i.e., their set difference). Note we have \\nchosen to define error over the entire distribution of instances-not simply over \\nthe training examples-because this is the true error we expect to encounter when \\nactually using the learned hypothesis h on subsequent instances drawn from D. \\nNote that error depends strongly on the unknown probability distribution \\n2). For example, if D is a uniform probability distribution that assigns the same \\nprobability to every instance in X, then the error for the hypothesis in Figure 7.1 \\nwill be the fraction of the total instance space that falls into the region where h \\nand c disagree. However, the same h and c will have a much higher error if D \\nhappens to assign very high probability to instances for which h and c disagree. \\nIn the extreme, if V happens to assign zero probability to the instances for which\"), Document(metadata={'producer': 'macOS Version 11.2.3 (Build 20D91) Quartz PDFContext', 'creator': 'Preview', 'creationdate': \"D:20210312135113Z00'00'\", 'title': 'Machine - Learning - Tom Mitchell.pdf', 'moddate': \"D:20210312135113Z00'00'\", 'source': '..\\\\Data\\\\PDFiles\\\\MachineLearningTomMitchell.pdf', 'total_pages': 421, 'page': 216, 'page_label': '217'}, page_content='Instance space X \\nC \\nWhere c \\nand h disagree \\nFIGURE 7.1 \\nThe error of hypothesis h with respect to target concept c.

L can only observe the performance of h over the training examples, \\nand it must choose its output hypothesis on this basis only. We will use the term \\ntraining error to refer to the fraction of training examples misclassified by h, in \\ncontrast to the true error defined above. Much of our analysis of the complexity of \\nlearning centers around the question \"how probable is it that the observed training \\nerror for h gives a misleading estimate of the true errorv(h)?\" \\nNotice the close relationship between this question and the questions con- \\nsidered in Chapter 5. Recall that in Chapter 5 we defined the sample error of h \\nwith respect to a set S of examples to be the fraction of S rnisclassified by h. The \\ntraining error defined above is just the sample error when S is the set of training \\nexamples. In Chapter 5 we determined the probability that the sample error will \\nprovide a misleading estimate of the true error, under the assumption that the data \\nsample S is drawn independent of h. However, when S is the set of training data, \\nthe learned hypothesis h depends very much on S! Therefore, in this chapter we \\nprovide an analysis that addresses this important special case. \\n7.2.3 PAC Learnability \\nOur aim is to characterize classes of target concepts that can be reliably learned \\nfrom a reasonable number of randomly drawn training examples and a reasonable \\namount of computation. \\nWhat kinds of statements about learnability should we guess hold true? \\nWe might try to characterize the number of training examples needed to learn'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'macOS Version 11.2.3 (Build 20D91) Quartz PDFContext', 'creator': 'Preview', 'creationdate': \"D:20210312135113Z00'00'\", 'title': 'Machine - Learning - Tom Mitchell.pdf', 'moddate': \"D:20210312135113Z00'00'\", 'source': '..\\\\Data\\\\PDFiles\\\\MachineLearningTomMitchell.pdf', 'total_pages': 421, 'page': 217, 'page_label': '218'}, page_content='a hypothesis h for which errorD(h) = 0. Unfortunately, it turns out this is fu- \\ntile in the setting we are considering, for two reasons. First, unless we provide \\ntraining examples corresponding to every possible instance in X (an unrealistic \\nassumption), there may be multiple hypotheses consistent with the provided train- \\ning examples, and the learner cannot be certain to pick the one corresponding \\nto the target concept. Second, given that the training examples are drawn ran- \\ndomly, there will always be some nonzero probability that the training examples \\nencountered by the learner will be misleading. (For example, although we might \\nfrequently see skiers of different heights, on any given day there is some small \\nchance that all observed training examples will happen to be 2 meters tall.) \\nTo accommodate these two difficulties, we weaken our demands on the \\nlearner in two ways. First, we will not require that the learner output a zero error \\nhypothesis-we will require only that its error be bounded by some constant, c, \\nthat can be made arbitrarily small. Second, we will not require that the learner \\nsucceed for every sequence of randomly drawn training examples-we will require \\nonly that its probability of failure be bounded by some constant, 6, that can be \\nmade arbitrarily small. In short, we require only that the learner probably learn a \\nhypothesis that is approximately correct-hence the term probably approximately \\ncorrect learning, or PAC learning for short. \\nConsider some class C of possible target concepts and a learner L using \\nhypothesis space H. Loosely speaking, we will say that the concept class C \\nis PAC-learnable by L using H if, for any target concept c in C, L will with \\nprobability (1 - 6) output a hypothesis h with errorv(h) < c, after observing a \\nreasonable number of training examples and performing a reasonable amount of \\ncomputation. More precisely, \\nDefinition: Consider a concept class C defined over a set of instances X of length \\nn and a learner L using hypothesis space H. C is PAC-learnable by L using H \\nif for all c E C, distributions D over X, E such that 0 < 6 < 112, and 6 such that \\n0 < 6 < 112, learner L will with probability at least (1 - 6) output a hypothesis \\nh E H such that errorv(h) 5 E, in time that is polynomial in 116, 116, n, and \\nsize(c). \\nOur definition requires two things from L. First, L must, with arbitrarily high \\nprobability (1 - 6), output a hypothesis having arbitrarily low error (6). Second, it \\nmust do so efficiently-in time that grows at most polynomially with 1/c and 116, \\nwhich define the strength of our demands on the output hypothesis, and with n and \\nsize(c) that define the inherent complexity of the underlying instance space X and \\nconcept class C. Here, n is the size of instances in X. For example, if instances in \\nX are conjunctions of k boolean features, then n = k. The second space parameter, \\nsize(c), is the encoding length of c in C, assuming some representation for C. \\nFor example, if concepts in C are conjunctions of up to k boolean features, each \\ndescribed by listing the indices of the features in the conjunction, then size(c) is \\nthe number of boolean features actually used to describe c. \\nOur definition of PAC learning may at first appear to be concerned only \\nwith the computational resources required for learning, whereas in practice we are'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'macOS Version 11.2.3 (Build 20D91) Quartz PDFContext', 'creator': 'Preview', 'creationdate': \"D:20210312135113Z00'00'\", 'title': 'Machine - Learning - Tom Mitchell.pdf', 'moddate': \"D:20210312135113Z00'00'\", 'source': '..\\\\Data\\\\PDFiles\\\\MachineLearningTomMitchell.pdf', 'total_pages': 421, 'page': 218, 'page_label': '219'}, page_content=\"usually more concerned with the number of training examples required. However, \\nthe two are very closely related: If L requires some minimum processing time \\nper training example, then for C to be PAC-learnable by L, L must learn from a \\npolynomial number of training examples. In fact, a typical approach to showing \\nthat some class C of target concepts is PAC-learnable, is to first show that each \\ntarget concept in C can be learned from a polynomial number of training examples \\nand then show that the processing time per example is also polynomially bounded. \\nBefore moving on, we should point out a restrictive assumption implicit \\nin our definition of PAC-learnable. This definition implicitly assumes that the \\nlearner's hypothesis space H contains a hypothesis with arbitrarily small error for \\nevery target concept in C. This follows from the requirement in the above defini- \\ntion that the learner succeed when the error bound 6 is arbitrarily close to zero. Of \\ncourse this is difficult to assure if one does not know C in advance (what is C for \\na program that must learn to recognize faces from images?), unless H is taken to \\nbe the power set of X. As pointed out in Chapter 2, such an unbiased H will not \\nsupport accurate generalization from a reasonable number of training examples. \\nNevertheless, the results based on the PAC learning model provide useful insights \\n/ regarding the relative complexity of different learning problems and regarding the \\nrate at which generalization accuracy improves with additional training examples. \\nFurthermore, in Section 7.3.1 we will lift this restrictive assumption, to consider \\nthe case in which the learner makes no prior assumption about the form of the \\ntarget concept. \\n7.3 SAMPLE COMPLEXITY FOR FINITE HYPOTHESIS SPACES \\nAs noted above, PAC-learnability is largely determined by the number of training \\nexamples required by the learner. The growth in the number of required training \\nexamples with problem size, called the sample complexity of the learning problem, \\nis the characteristic that is usually of greatest interest. The reason is that in most \\npractical settings the factor that most limits success of the learner is the limited \\navailability of training data. \\nHere we present a general bound on the sample complexity for a very broad \\nclass of learners, called consistent learners. A learner is consistent if it outputs \\nhypotheses that perfectly fit the training data, whenever possible. It is quite rea- \\nsonable to ask that a learning algorithm be consistent, given that we typically \\nprefer a hypothesis that fits the training data over one that does not. Note that \\nmany of the learning algorithms discussed in earlier chapters, including all the \\nlearning algorithms described in Chapter 2, are consistent learners. \\nCan we derive a bound on the number of training examples required by \\nany consistent learner, independent of the specific algorithm it uses to derive a \\nconsistent hypothesis? The answer is yes. To accomplish this, it is useful to recall \\nthe definition of version space from Chapter 2. There we defined the version space, \\nVSH,D, to be the set of all hypotheses h E H that correctly classify the training \\nexamples D. \\nvs,~ = {h E HI(V(x, 4~)) E D) (h(x) = ~(x))}\"), Document(metadata={'producer': 'macOS Version 11.2.3 (Build 20D91) Quartz PDFContext', 'creator': 'Preview', 'creationdate': \"D:20210312135113Z00'00'\", 'title': 'Machine - Learning - Tom Mitchell.pdf', 'moddate': \"D:20210312135113Z00'00'\", 'source': '..\\\\Data\\\\PDFiles\\\\MachineLearningTomMitchell.pdf', 'total_pages': 421, 'page': 219, 'page_label': '220'}, page_content=\"The significance of the version space here is that every consistent learner outputs \\na hypothesis belonging to the version space, regardless of the instance space X, \\nhypothesis space H, or training data D. The reason is simply that by definition \\nthe version space VSH,D contains every consistent hypothesis in H. Therefore, \\nto bound the number of examples needed by any consistent learner, we need only \\nbound the number of examples needed to assure that the version space contains no \\nunacceptable hypotheses. The following definition, after Haussler (1988), states \\nthis condition precisely. \\nDefinition: Consider a hypothesis space H, target concept c, instance distribution \\nV, and set of training examples D of c.

Given that we have k hypotheses with error greater \\nthan E, the probability that at least one of these will be consistent with all rn training \\nexamples is at most \\nAnd since k 5 I H 1, this is at most 1 H I(1- 6)\".

For example, \\nalthough the probability of failing to exhaust the version space must lie in the \\ninterval [O, 11, the bound given by the theorem grows linearly with IHI. For \\nsufficiently large hypothesis spaces, this bound can easily be greater than one. \\nAs a result, the bound given by the inequality in Equation (7.2) can substantially \\noverestimate the number of training examples required. The weakness of this \\nbound is mainly due to the IHI term, which arises in the proof when summing \\nthe probability that a single hypothesis could be unacceptable, over all possible \\nhypotheses. In fact, a much tighter bound is possible in many cases, as well as a \\nbound that covers infinitely large hypothesis spaces. This will be the subject of \\nSection 7.4. \\n7.3.1 Agnostic Learning and Inconsistent Hypotheses \\nEquation (7.2) is important because it tells us how many training examples suffice \\nto ensure (with probability (1 - 6)) that every hypothesis in H having zero training \\nerror will have a true error of at most E. Unfortunately, if H does not contain \\nthe target concept c, then a zero-error hypothesis cannot always be found. In this \\ncase, the most we might ask of our learner is to output the hypothesis from H \\nthat has the minimum error over the training examples. A learner that makes no \\nassumption that the target concept is representable by H and that simply finds \\nthe hypothesis with minimum training error, is often called an agnostic learner, \\nbecause it makes no prior commitment about whether or not C g H. \\nAlthough Equation (7.2) is based on the assumption that the learner outputs \\na zero-error hypothesis, a similar bound can be found for this more general case \\nin which the learner entertains hypotheses with nonzero training error. To state \\nthis precisely, let D denote the particular set of training examples available to \\nthe learner, in contrast to D, which denotes the probability distribution over the \\nentire set of instances. Let errorD(h) denote the training error of hypothesis h. \\nIn particular, error~(h) is defined as the fraction of the training examples in \\nD that are misclassified by h. Note the errorD(h) over the particular sample of \\ntraining data D may differ from the true error errorv(h) over the entire probability \\ndistribution 2). Now let hb,,, denote the hypothesis from H having lowest training \\nerror over the training examples. How many training examples suffice to ensure \\n(with high probability) that its true error errorD(hb,,,) will be no more than \\nE + errorg (hbest)? Notice the question considered in the previous section is just a \\nspecial case of this question, when errorD(hb,,) happens to be zero. \\nThis question can be answered (see Exercise 7.3) using an argument analo- \\ngous to the proof of Theorem 7.1. It is useful here to invoke the general Hoeffding \\nbounds (sometimes called the additive Chernoff bounds).

While Equation (7.2) is quite \\nuseful, there are two drawbacks to characterizing sample complexity in terms of \\nIHI. First, it can lead to quite weak bounds (recall that the bound on 6 can be \\nsignificantly greater than 1 for large I H I). Second, in the case of infinite hypothesis \\nspaces we cannot apply Equation (7.2) at all! \\nHere we consider a second measure of the complexity of H, called the \\nVapnik-Chervonenkis dimension of H (VC dimension, or VC(H), for short). As \\nwe shall see, we can state bounds on sample complexity that use VC(H) rather \\nthan IHI. In many cases, the sample complexity bounds based on VC(H) will \\nbe tighter than those from Equation (7.2). In addition, these bounds allow us to \\ncharacterize the sample complexity of many infinite hypothesis spaces, and can \\nbe shown to be fairly tight. \\n7.4.1 Shattering a Set of Instances \\nThe VC dimension measures the complexity of the hypothesis space H, not by the \\nnumber of distinct hypotheses 1 H 1, but instead by the number of distinct instances \\nfrom X that can be completely discriminated using H. \\nTo make this notion more precise, we first define the notion of shattering a \\nset of instances. Consider some subset of instances S E X. For example, Figure 7.3 \\nshows a subset of three instances from X. Each hypothesis h from H imposes some \\ndichotomy on S; that is, h partitions S into the two subsets {x E Slh(x) = 1) and \\n{x E Slh(x) = 0). Given some instance set S, there are 2ISI possible dichotomies, \\nthough H may be unable to represent some of these. We say that H shatters S if \\nevery possible dichotomy of S can be represented by some hypothesis from H. \\nDefinition: A set of instances S is shattered by hypothesis space H if and only if \\nfor every dichotomy.of S there exists some hypothesis in H consistent with this \\ndichotomy. \\nFigure 7.3 illustrates a set S of three instances that is shattered by the \\nhypothesis space. Notice that each of the 23 dichotomies of these three instances \\nis covered by some hypothesis. \\nNote that if a set of instances is not shattered by a hypothesis space, then \\nthere must be some concept (dichotomy) that can be defined over the instances, \\nbut that cannot be represented by the hypothesis space.

Recall from Chapter 2 that an unbiased hypothesis space is \\none capable of representing every possible concept (dichotomy) definable over the \\ninstance space X. Put briefly, an unbiased hypothesis space H is one that shatters \\nthe instance space X. What if H cannot shatter X, but can shatter some large \\nsubset S of X? Intuitively, it seems reasonable to say that the larger the subset \\nof X that can be shattered, the more expressive H. The VC dimension of H is \\nprecisely this measure. \\nDefinition: The Vapnik-Chervonenkis dimension, VC(H), of hypothesis space H \\ndefined over instance space X is the size of the largest finite subset of X shattered \\nby H. If arbitrarily large finite sets of X can be shattered by H, then VC(H) = oo. \\nNote that for any finite H, VC(H) 5 log2 IHI. To see this, suppose that \\nVC(H) = d.

What is VC(H)? \\nTo answer this question, we must find the largest subset of X that can be shat- \\ntered by H. Consider a particular subset containing two distinct instances, say \\nS = {3.1,5.7}. Can S be shattered by H? Yes. For example, the four hypotheses \\n(1 < x < 2), (1 < x < 4), (4 < x < 7), and (1 < x < 7) will do. Together, they \\nrepresent each of the four dichotomies over S, covering neither instance, either \\none of the instances, and both of the instances, respectively. Since we have found \\na set of size two that can be shattered by H, we know the VC dimension of H \\nis at least two. Is there a set of size three that can be shattered? Consider a set \\nS = (xo, xl, x2} containing three arbitrary instances. Without loss of generality, \\nassume xo < xl < x2. Clearly this set cannot be shattered, because the dichotomy \\nthat includes xo and x2, but not XI, cannot be represented by a single closed inter- \\nval. Therefore, no subset S of size three can be shattered, and VC(H) = 2. Note \\nhere that H is infinite, but VC(H) finite. \\nNext consider the set X of instances corresponding to points on the x, y plane \\n(see Figure 7.4). Let H be the set of all linear decision surfaces in the plane. In \\nother words, H is the hypothesis space corresponding to a single perceptron unit \\nwith two inputs (see Chapter 4 for a general discussion of perceptrons). What \\nis the VC dimension of this H? It is easy to see that any two distinct points in \\nthe plane can be shattered by H, because we can find four linear surfaces that \\ninclude neither, either, or both points. What about sets of three points? As long as \\nthe points are not colinear, we will be able to find 23 linear surfaces that shatter \\nthem. Of course three colinear points cannot be shattered (for the same reason that \\nthe three points on the real line could not be shattered in the previous example). \\nWhat is VC(H) in this case-two or three? It is at least three. The definition of \\nVC dimension indicates that if we find any set of instances of size d that can \\nbe shattered, then VC(H) 2 d. To show that VC(H) < d, we must show that \\nno set of size d can be shattered. In this example, no sets of size four can be \\nshattered, so VC(H) = 3. More generally, it can be shown that the VC dimension \\nof linear decision surfaces in an r dimensional space (i.e., the VC dimension of a \\nperceptron with r inputs) is r + 1. \\nAs one final example, suppose each instance in X is described by the con- \\njunction of exactly three boolean literals, and suppose that each hypothesis in H is \\ndescribed by the conjunction of up to three boolean literals.

This section presents a general result that allows computing the \\nVC dimension of layered acyclic networks, based on the structure of the network \\nand the VC dimension of its individual units. This VC dimension can then be used \\nto bound the number of training examples sufficient to probably approximately \\ncorrectly learn a feedforward network to desired values of c and 6. This section \\nmay be skipped on a first reading without loss of continuity. \\nConsider a network, G, of units, which forms a layered directed acyclic \\ngraph. A directed acyclic graph is one for which the edges have a direction (e.g., \\nthe units have inputs and outputs), and in which there are no directed cycles. \\nA layered graph is one whose nodes can be partitioned into layers such that \\nall directed edges from nodes at layer 1 go to nodes at layer 1 + 1. The layered \\nfeedforward neural networks discussed throughout Chapter 4 are examples of such \\nlayered directed acyclic graphs. \\nIt turns out that we can bound the VC dimension of such networks based on \\ntheir graph structure and the VC dimension of the primitive units from which they \\nare constructed. To formalize this, we must first define a few more terms. Let n \\nbe the number of inputs to the network G, and let us assume that there is just one \\noutput node. Let each internal unit Ni of G (i.e., each node that is not an input) \\nhave at most r inputs and implement a boolean-valued function ci : 8'' + (0, 1) \\nfrom some function class C.

As in the PAC setting, we assume the learner \\nreceives a sequence of training examples. However, here we demand that upon \\nreceiving each example x, the learner must predict the target value c(x), before \\nit is shown the correct target value by the trainer. The question considered is \\n\"How many mistakes will the learner make in its predictions before it learns the \\ntarget concept?\\' This question is significant in practical settings where learning \\nmust be done while the system is in actual use, rather than during some off-line \\ntraining stage. For example, if the system is to learn to predict which credit card \\npurchases should be approved and which are fraudulent, based on data collected \\nduring use, then we are interested in minimizing the total number of mistakes it \\nwill make before converging to the correct target function. Here the total num- \\nber of mistakes can be even more important than the total number of training \\nexamples. \\nThis mistake bound learning problem may be studied in various specific \\nsettings. For example, we might count the number of mistakes made before PAC \\nlearning the target concept. In the examples below, we consider instead the number \\nof mistakes made before learning the target concept exactly. Learning the target \\nconcept exactly means converging to a hypothesis such that (Vx)h(x) = c(x). \\n7.5.1 Mistake Bound for the FIND-S Algorithm \\nTo illustrate, consider again the hypothesis space H consisting of conjunctions of \\nup to n boolean literals 11 . . .1, and their negations (e.g., Rich A -Handsome). \\nRecall the FIND-S algorithm from Chapter 2, which incrementally computes the \\nmaximally specific hypothesis consistent with the training examples. A straight- \\nforward implementation of FIND-S for the hypothesis space H is as follows:'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'macOS Version 11.2.3 (Build 20D91) Quartz PDFContext', 'creator': 'Preview', 'creationdate': \"D:20210312135113Z00'00'\", 'title': 'Machine - Learning - Tom Mitchell.pdf', 'moddate': \"D:20210312135113Z00'00'\", 'source': '..\\\\Data\\\\PDFiles\\\\MachineLearningTomMitchell.pdf', 'total_pages': 421, 'page': 232, 'page_label': '233'}, page_content='CHAPTER 7 COMPUTATIONAL LEARNING THEORY 221 \\nFIND-S: \\n0 Initialize h to the most specific hypothesis l1 A -II A 12 A -12.. .1, A -1, \\n0 For each positive training instance x \\n0 Remove from h any literal that is not satisfied by x \\n0 Output hypothesis h. \\nFIND-S converges in the limit to a hypothesis that makes no errors, provided \\nC H and provided the training data is noise-free. FIND-S begins with the most \\nspecific hypothesis (which classifies every instance a negative example), then \\nincrementally generalizes this hypothesis as needed to cover observed positive \\ntraining examples. For the hypothesis representation used here, this generalization \\nstep consists of deleting unsatisfied literals. \\nCan we prove a bound on the total number of mistakes that FIND-S will make \\nbefore exactly learning the target concept c? The answer is yes. To see this, note \\nfirst that if c E H, then FIND-S can never mistakenly classify a negative example as \\npositive. The reason is that its current hypothesis h is always at least as specific as \\n1 the target concept e. Therefore, to calculate the number of mistakes it will make, \\nwe need only count the number of mistakes it will make misclassifying truly \\npositive examples as negative. How many such mistakes can occur before FIND-S \\nlearns c exactly? Consider the first positive example encountered by FIND-S. The \\nlearner will certainly make a mistake classifying this example, because its initial \\nhypothesis labels every instance negative. However, the result will be that half \\nof the 2n terms in its initial hypothesis will be eliminated, leaving only n terms. \\nFor each subsequent positive example that is mistakenly classified by the current \\nhypothesis, at least one more of the remaining n terms must be eliminated from \\nthe hypothesis. Therefore, the total number of mistakes can be at most n + 1. This \\nnumber of mistakes will be required in the worst case, corresponding to learning \\nthe most general possible target concept (Vx)c(x) = 1 and corresponding to a \\nworst case sequence of instances that removes only one literal per mistake. \\n7.5.2 Mistake Bound for the HALVING Algorithm \\nAs a second example, consider an algorithm that learns by maintaining a descrip- \\ntion of the version space, incrementally refining the version space as each new \\ntraining example is encountered. The CANDIDATE-ELIMINATION algorithm and the \\nLIST-THEN-ELIMINATE algorithm from Chapter 2 are examples of such algorithms. \\nIn this section we derive a worst-case bound on the number of mistakes that will \\nbe made by such a learner, for any finite hypothesis space H, assuming again that \\nthe target concept must be learned exactly. \\nTo analyze the number of mistakes made while learning we must first specify \\nprecisely how the learner will make predictions given a new instance x. Let us \\nassume this prediction is made by taking a majority vote among the hypotheses in \\nthe current version space.

In this case, once the correct classification is \\nrevealed to the learner, the version space will be reduced to at most half its current \\nsize (i.e., only those hypotheses that voted with the minority will be retained). \\nGiven that each mistake reduces the size of the version space by at least half, \\nand given that the initial version space contains only I H I members, the maximum \\nnumber of mistakes possible before the version space contains just one member \\nis log2 I H I. In fact one can show the bound is Llog, I H (1. Consider, for example, \\nthe case in which IHI = 7. The first mistake must reduce IHI to at most 3, and \\nthe second mistake will then reduce it to 1. \\nNote that [log2 IH(1 is a worst-case bound, and that it is possible for the \\nHALVING algorithm to learn the target concept exactly without making any mis- \\ntakes at all! This can occur because even when the majority vote is correct, the \\nalgorithm will remove the incorrect, minority hypotheses. If this occurs over the \\nentire training sequence, then the version space may be reduced to a single member \\nwhile making no mistakes along the way. \\nOne interesting extension to the HALVING algorithm is to allow the hy- \\npotheses to vote with different weights. Chapter 6 describes the Bayes optimal \\nclassifier, which takes such a weighted vote among hypotheses. In the Bayes op- \\ntimal classifier, the weight assigned to each hypothesis is the estimated posterior \\nprobability that it describes the target concept, given the training data. Later in \\nthis section we describe a different algorithm based on weighted voting, called \\nthe WEIGHTED-MAJORITY algorithm. \\n7.5.3 Optimal Mistake Bounds \\nThe above analyses give worst-case mistake bounds for two specific algorithms: \\nFIND-S and CANDIDATE-ELIMINATION. It is interesting to ask what is the optimal \\nmistake bound for an arbitrary concept class C, assuming H = C. By optimal \\nmistake bound we mean the lowest worst-case mistake bound over all possible \\nlearning algorithms. To be more precise, for any learning algorithm A and any \\ntarget concept c, let MA(c) denote the maximum over all possible sequences of \\ntraining examples of the number of mistakes made by A to exactly learn c.

The WEIGHTED-MAJORITY algorithm makes \\npredictions by taking a weighted vote among a pool of prediction algorithms and \\nlearns by altering the weight associated with each prediction algorithm. These \\nprediction algorithms can be taken to be the alternative hypotheses in H, or they \\ncan be taken to be alternative learning algorithms that themselves vary over time. \\nAll that we require of a prediction algorithm is that it predict the value of the target \\nconcept, given an instance. One interesting property of the WEIGHTED-MAJORITY \\nalgorithm is that it is able to accommodate inconsistent training data. This is \\nbecause it does not eliminate a hypothesis that is found to be inconsistent with \\nsome training example, but rather reduces its weight. A second interesting property \\nis that we can bound the number of mistakes made by WEIGHTED-MAJORITY in \\nterms of the number of mistakes committed by the best of the pool of prediction \\nalgorithms. \\nThe WEIGHTED-MAJORITY algorithm begins by assigning a weight of 1 to \\neach prediction algorithm, then considers the training examples.

One key difference between these approaches and the meth- \\nods discussed in other chapters is that instance-based approaches can construct \\na different approximation to the target function for each distinct query instance \\nthat must be classified. In fact, many techniques construct only a local approxi- \\nmation to the target function that applies in the neighborhood of the new query \\ninstance, and never construct an approximation designed to perform well over the \\nentire instance space. This has significant advantages when the target function is \\nvery complex, but can still be described by a collection of less complex local \\napproximations. \\nInstance-based methods can also use more complex, symbolic representa- \\ntions for instances. In case-based learning, instances are represented in this fashion \\nand the process for identifying \"neighboring\" instances is elaborated accordingly. \\nCase-based reasoning has been applied to tasks such as storing and reusing past \\nexperience at a help desk, reasoning about legal cases by referring to previous \\ncases, and solving complex scheduling problems by reusing relevant portions of \\npreviously solved problems. \\nOne disadvantage of instance-based approaches is that the cost of classifying \\nnew instances can be high. This is due to the fact that nearly all computation \\ntakes place at classification time rather than when the training examples are first \\nencountered. Therefore, techniques for efficiently indexing training examples are \\na significant practical issue in reducing the computation required at query time. \\nA second disadvantage to many instance-based approaches, especially nearest- \\nneighbor approaches, is that they typically consider all attributes of the instances \\nwhen attempting to retrieve similar training examples from memory. If the target \\nconcept depends on only a few of the many available attributes, then the instances \\nthat are truly most \"similar\" may well be a large distance apart. \\nIn the next section we introduce the k-NEAREST NEIGHBOR learning algo- \\nrithm, including several variants of this widely-used approach. The subsequent \\nsection discusses locally weighted regression, a learning method that constructs \\nlocal approximations to the target function and that can be viewed as a general- \\nization of k-NEAREST NEIGHBOR algorithms. We then describe radial basis function \\nnetworks, which provide an interesting bridge between instance-based and neural \\nnetwork learning algorithms. The next section discusses case-based reasoning, an \\ninstance-based approach that employs symbolic representations and knowledge- \\nbased inference. This section includes an example application of case-based rea- \\nsoning to a problem in engineering design. Finally, we discuss the fundarnen- \\ntal differences in capabilities that distinguish lazy learning methods discussed in \\nthis chapter from eager learning methods discussed in the other chapters of this \\nbook. \\n8.2 k-NEAREST NEIGHBOR LEARNING \\nThe most basic instance-based method is the k-NEAREST NEIGHBOR algorithm.

It is robust to noisy training \\ndata and quite effective when it is provided a sufficiently large set of training \\ndata.

The basis for classifying \\nnew query points is easily understood based on the diagrams in Figure 8.1. The \\ninductive bias corresponds to an assumption that the classification of an instance \\nx, will be most similar to the classification of other instances that are nearby in \\nEuclidean distance. \\nOne practical issue in applying k-NEAREST NEIGHBOR algorithms is that the \\ndistance between instances is calculated based on all attributes of the instance\"), Document(metadata={'producer': 'macOS Version 11.2.3 (Build 20D91) Quartz PDFContext', 'creator': 'Preview', 'creationdate': \"D:20210312135113Z00'00'\", 'title': 'Machine - Learning - Tom Mitchell.pdf', 'moddate': \"D:20210312135113Z00'00'\", 'source': '..\\\\Data\\\\PDFiles\\\\MachineLearningTomMitchell.pdf', 'total_pages': 421, 'page': 246, 'page_label': '247'}, page_content='(i.e., on all axes in the Euclidean space containing the instances). This lies in \\ncontrast to methods such as rule and decision tree learning systems that select \\nonly a subset of the instance attributes when forming the hypothesis. To see the \\neffect of this policy, consider applying k-NEAREST NEIGHBOR to a problem in which \\neach instance is described by 20 attributes, but where only 2 of these attributes \\nare relevant to determining the classification for the particular target function. In \\nthis case, instances that have identical values for the 2 relevant attributes may \\nnevertheless be distant from one another in the 20-dimensional instance space. \\nAs a result, the similarity metric used by k-NEAREST NEIGHBOR--depending on \\nall 20 attributes-will be misleading. The distance between neighbors will be \\ndominated by the large number of irrelevant attributes. This difficulty, which \\narises when many irrelevant attributes are present, is sometimes referred to as the \\ncurse of dimensionality. Nearest-neighbor approaches are especially sensitive to \\nthis problem. \\nOne interesting approach to overcoming this problem is to weight each \\nattribute differently when calculating the distance between two instances. This \\ncorresponds to stretching the axes in the Euclidean space, shortening the axes that \\ncorrespond to less relevant attributes, and lengthening the axes that correspond \\nto more relevant attributes. The amount by which each axis should be stretched \\ncan be determined automatically using a cross-validation approach. To see how, \\nfirst note that we wish to stretch (multiply) the jth axis by some factor zj, where \\nthe values zl . . . z, are chosen to minimize the true classification error of the \\nlearning algorithm. Second, note that this true error can be estimated using cross- \\nvalidation. Hence, one algorithm is to select a random subset of the available \\ndata to use as training examples, then determine the values of zl . . . z, that lead \\nto the minimum error in classifying the remaining examples. By repeating this \\nprocess multiple times the estimate for these weighting factors can be made more \\naccurate. This process of stretching the axes in order to optimize the performance \\nof k-NEAREST NEIGHBOR provides a mechanism for suppressing the impact of \\nirrelevant attributes. \\nAn even more drastic alternative is to completely eliminate the least relevant \\nattributes from the instance space. This is equivalent to setting some of the zi \\nscaling factors to zero. Moore and Lee (1994) discuss efficient cross-validation \\nmethods for selecting relevant subsets of the attributes for k-NEAREST NEIGHBOR \\nalgorithms. In particular, they explore methods based on leave-one-out cross- \\nvalidation, in which the set of m training instances is repeatedly divided into a \\ntraining set of size m - 1 and test set of size 1, in all possible ways.

Alternatively, we could stretch each axis by a value that varies over \\nthe instance space.

More complex functional forms are not often found because (1) the cost \\nof fitting more complex functions for each query instance is prohibitively high, \\nand (2) these simple approximations model the target function quite well over a \\nsufficiently small subregion of the instance space. \\n8.4 RADIAL BASIS FUNCTIONS \\nOne approach to function approximation that is closely related to distance-weighted \\nregression and also to artificial neural networks is learning with radial basis func- \\ntions (Powell 1987; Broomhead and Lowe 1988; Moody and Darken 1989). In \\nthis approach, the learned hypothesis is a function of the form \\nwhere each xu is an instance from X and where the kernel function K,(d(x,, x)) \\nis defined so that it decreases as the distance d(x,, x) increases. Here k is a user- \\nprovided constant that specifies the number of kernel functions to be included. \\nEven though f(x) is a global approximation to f (x), the contribution from each \\nof the Ku(d (xu, x)) terms is localized to a region nearby the point xu.

This approach can be much more effi- \\ncient than the first approach, especially when the number of training examples \\nis large. The set of kernel functions may be distributed with centers spaced uni- \\nformly throughout the instance space X. Alternatively, we may wish to distribute \\nthe centers nonuniformly, especially if the instances themselves are found to be \\ndistributed nonuniformly over X. In this later case, we can pick kernel function \\ncenters by randomly selecting a subset of the training instances, thereby sampling \\nthe underlying distribution of instances. Alternatively, we may identify prototyp- \\nical clusters of instances, then add a kernel function centered at each cluster. The \\nplacement of the kernel functions in this fashion can be accomplished using un- \\nsupervised clustering algorithms that fit the training instances (but not their target \\nvalues) to a mixture of Gaussians. The EM algorithm discussed in Section 6.12.1 \\nprovides one algorithm for choosing the means of a mixture of k Gaussians to \\nbest fit the observed instances. In the case of the EM algorithm, the means are \\nchosen to maximize the probability of observing the instances xi, given the k \\nestimated means. Note the target function value f (xi) of the instance does not \\nenter into the calculation of kernel centers by unsupervised clustering methods. \\nThe only role of the target values f (xi) in this case is to determine the output \\nlayer weights w,. \\nTo summarize, radial basis function networks provide a global approxima- \\ntion to the target function, represented by a linear combination of many local \\nkernel functions. The value for any given kernel function is non-negligible only \\nwhen the input x falls into the region defined by its particular center and width. \\nThus, the network can be viewed as a smooth linear combination of many local \\napproximations to the target function. One key advantage to RBF networks is that \\nthey can be trained much more efficiently than feedforward networks trained with \\nBACKPROPAGATION. This follows from the fact that the input layer and the output \\nlayer of an RBF are trained separately. \\n8.5 CASE-BASED REASONING \\nInstance-based methods such as k-NEAREST NEIGHBOR and locally weighted re- \\ngression share three key properties. First, they are lazy learning methods in that \\nthey defer the decision of how to generalize beyond the training data until a new \\nquery instance is observed. Second, they classify new query instances by ana- \\nlyzing similar instances while ignoring instances that are very different from the \\nquery. Third, they represent instances as real-valued points in an n-dimensional \\nEuclidean space. Case-based reasoning (CBR) is a learning paradigm based on \\nthe first two of these principles, but not the third. In CBR, instances are typi- \\nca:'y represented using more rich symbolic descriptions, and the methods used \\nto retrieve similar instances are correspondingly more elaborate. CBR has been \\napplied to problems such as conceptual design of mechanical devices based on \\na stored library of previous designs (Sycara et al. 1992), reasoning about new \\nlegal cases based on previous rulings (Ashley 1990), and solving planning and\"), Document(metadata={'producer': 'macOS Version 11.2.3 (Build 20D91) Quartz PDFContext', 'creator': 'Preview', 'creationdate': \"D:20210312135113Z00'00'\", 'title': 'Machine - Learning - Tom Mitchell.pdf', 'moddate': \"D:20210312135113Z00'00'\", 'source': '..\\\\Data\\\\PDFiles\\\\MachineLearningTomMitchell.pdf', 'total_pages': 421, 'page': 252, 'page_label': '253'}, page_content='CHAPTER 8 INSTANCEBASED LEARNING 241 \\nscheduling problems by reusing and combining portions of previous solutions to \\nsimilar problems (Veloso 1992). \\nLet us consider a prototypical example of a case-based reasoning system to \\nground our discussion. The CADET system (Sycara et al. 1992) employs case- \\nbased reasoning to assist in the conceptual design of simple mechanical devices \\nsuch as water faucets. It uses a library containing approximately 75 previous \\ndesigns and design fragments to suggest conceptual designs to meet the specifi- \\ncations of new design problems. Each instance stored in memory (e.g., a water \\npipe) is represented by describing both its structure and its qualitative function. \\nNew design problems are then presented by specifying the desired function and \\nrequesting the corresponding structure. This problem setting is illustrated in Fig- \\nure 8.3. The top half of the figure shows the description of a typical stored case \\ncalled a T-junction pipe. Its function is represented in terms of the qualitative re- \\nlationships among the waterflow levels and temperatures at its inputs and outputs. \\nIn the functional description at its right, an arrow with a \"+\" label indicates that \\nthe variable at the arrowhead increases with the variable at its tail.

The bottom half of this figure depicts a new design problem described \\nby its desired function. This particular function describes the required behavior of \\none type of water faucet. Here Q, refers to the flow of cold water into the faucet, \\nQh to the input flow of hot water, and Q, to the single mixed flow out of the \\nfaucet. Similarly, T,, Th, and T, refer to the temperatures of the cold water, hot \\nwater, and mixed water respectively. The variable C, denotes the control signal \\nfor temperature that is input to the faucet, and Cf denotes the control signal for \\nwaterflow. Note the description of the desired function specifies that these con- \\ntrols C, and Cf are to influence the water flows Q, and Qh, thereby indirectly \\ninfluencing the faucet output flow Q, and temperature T,. \\nGiven this functional specification for the new design problem, CADET \\nsearches its library for stored cases whose functional descriptions match the design \\nproblem. If an exact match is found, indicating that some stored case implements \\nexactly the desired function, then this case can be returned as a suggested solution \\nto the design problem. If no exact match occurs, CADET may find cases that \\nmatch various subgraphs of the desired functional specification. In Figure 8.3, for \\nexample, the T-junction function matches a subgraph of the water faucet function \\ngraph. More generally, CADET searches for subgraph isomorphisms between the \\ntwo function graphs, so that parts of a case can be found to match parts of the \\ndesign specification. Furthermore, the system may elaborate the original function \\nspecification graph in order to create functionally equivalent graphs that may \\nmatch still more cases. It uses general knowledge about physical influences to \\ncreate these elaborated function graphs. For example, it uses a rewrite rule that \\nallows it to rewrite the influence \\nThis rewrite rule can be interpreted as stating that if B must increase with A, \\nthen it is sufficient to find some other quantity x such that B increases with x, \\nand x increases with A. Here x is a universally quantified variable whose value \\nis bound when matching the function graph against the case library. In fact, the \\nfunction graph for the faucet shown in Figure 8.3 is an elaboration of the original - \\nfunctional specification produced by applying such rewrite rules. \\nBy retrieving multiple cases that match different subgraphs, the entire de- \\nsign can sometimes be pieced together. In general, the process of producing a \\nfinal solution from multiple retrieved cases can be very complex. It may require \\ndesigning portions of the system from first principles, in addition to merging re- \\ntrieved portions from stored cases. It may also require backtracking on earlier \\nchoices of design subgoals and, therefore, rejecting cases that were previously \\nretrieved.

It does not have the range of analysis algorithms \\nneeded to refine these abstract conceptual designs into final designs. \\nIt is instructive to examine the correspondence between the problem setting \\nof CADET and the general setting for instance-based methods such as k-NEAREST \\nNEIGHBOR. In CADET each stored training example describes a function graph \\nalong with the structure that implements it. New queries correspond to new func- \\ntion graphs. Thus, we can map the CADET problem into our standard notation by \\ndefining the space of instances X to be the space of all function graphs. The tar- \\nget function f maps function graphs to the structures that implement them. Each \\nstored training example (x, f (x)) is a pair that describes some function graph x \\nand the structure f (x) that implements x. The system must learn from the training \\nexample cases to output the structure f (x,) that successfully implements the input \\nfunction graph query x,. \\nThe above sketch of the CADET system illustrates several generic properties \\nof case-based reasoning systems that distinguish them from approaches such as \\nk-NEAREST NEIGHBOR. \\n0 Instances or cases may be represented by rich symbolic descriptions, such \\nas the function graphs used in CADET. This may require a similarity metric \\ndifferent from Euclidean distance, such as the size of the largest shared \\nsubgraph between two function graphs. \\n0 Multiple retrieved cases may be combined to form the solution to the new \\nproblem. This is similar to the k-NEAREST NEIGHBOR approach, in that mul- \\ntiple similar cases are used to construct a response for the new query. \\nHowever, the process for combining these multiple retrieved cases can be \\nvery different, relying on knowledge-based reasoning rather than statistical \\nmethods. \\n0 There may be a tight coupling between case retrieval, knowledge-based \\nreasoning, and problem solving. One simple example of this is found in \\nCADET, which uses generic knowledge about influences to rewrite function \\ngraphs during its attempt to find matching cases. Other systems have been \\ndeveloped that more fully integrate case-based reasoning into general search- \\nbased problem-solving systems. Two examples are ANAPRON (Golding and \\nRosenbloom 199 1) and PRODIGY/ANALOGY (Veloso 1992). \\nTo summarize, case-based reasoning is an instance-based learning method \\nin which instances (cases) may be rich relational descriptions and in which the re- \\ntrieval and combination of cases to solve the current query may rely on knowledge- \\nbased reasoning and search-intensive problem-solving methods. One current re- \\nsearch issue in case-based reasoning is to develop improved methods for indexing \\ncases. The central issue here is that syntactic similarity measures (e.g., subgraph \\nisomorphism between function graphs) provide only an approximate indication of \\nthe relevance of a particular case to a particular problem.

For example, in CADET the multi- \\nple retrieved design fragments may turn out to be incompatible with one another, \\nmaking it impossible to combine them into a consistent final design.

Importantly, \\nwhen such difficulties are detected they also provide training data for improving \\nthe similarity metric or, equivalently, the indexing structure for the case library. \\nIn particular, if a case is retrieved based on the similarity metric, but found to be \\nirrelevant based on further analysis, then the similarity metric should be refined \\nto reject this case for similar subsequent queries. \\n8.6 REMARKS ON LAZY AND EAGER LEARNING \\nIn this chapter we considered three lazy learning methods: the k-NEAREST NEIGH- \\nBOR algorithm, locally weighted regression, and case-based reasoning. We call \\nthese methods lazy because they defer the decision of how to generalize beyond \\nthe training data until each new query instance is encountered. We also discussed \\none eager learning method: the method for learning radial basis function networks. \\nWe call this method eager because it generalizes beyond the training data before \\nobserving the new query, committing at training time to the network structure and \\nweights that define its approximation to the target function. In this same sense, \\nevery other algorithm discussed elsewhere in this book (e.g., BACKPROPAGATION, \\nC4.5) is an eager learning algorithm. \\nAre there important differences in what can be achieved by lazy versus eager \\nlearning? Let us distinguish between two kinds of differences: differences in com- \\nputation time and differences in the classifications produced for new queries. There \\nare obviously differences in computation time between eager and lazy methods. \\nFor example, lazy methods will generally require less computation during training, \\nbut more computation when they must predict the target value for a new query. \\nThe more fundamental question is whether there are essential differences in \\nthe inductive bias that can be achieved by lazy versus eager methods. The key \\ndifference between lazy and eager methods in this regard is \\n0 Lazy methods may consider the query instance x, when deciding how to \\ngeneralize beyond the training data D. \\n0 Eager methods cannot. By the time they observe the query instance x, they \\nhave already chosen their (global) approximation to the target function. \\nDoes this distinction affect the generalization accuracy of the learner? It does if we \\nrequire that the lazy and eager learner employ the same hypothesis space H. To \\nillustrate, consider the hypothesis space consisting of linear functions. The locally \\nweighted linear regression algorithm discussed earlier is a lazy learning method \\nbased on this hypothesis space. For each new query x, it generalizes from the \\ntraining data by choosing a new hypothesis based on the training examples near x,. \\nIn contrast, an eager learner that uses the same hypothesis space of linear functions'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'macOS Version 11.2.3 (Build 20D91) Quartz PDFContext', 'creator': 'Preview', 'creationdate': \"D:20210312135113Z00'00'\", 'title': 'Machine - Learning - Tom Mitchell.pdf', 'moddate': \"D:20210312135113Z00'00'\", 'source': '..\\\\Data\\\\PDFiles\\\\MachineLearningTomMitchell.pdf', 'total_pages': 421, 'page': 256, 'page_label': '257'}, page_content='CHAPTER 8 INSTANCE-BASED LEARNING 245 \\nmust choose its approximation before the queries are observed. The eager learner \\nmust therefore commit to a single linear function hypothesis that covers the entire \\ninstance space and all future queries. The lazy method effectively uses a richer \\nhypothesis space because it uses many different local linear functions to form its \\nimplicit global approximation to the target function. Note this same situation holds \\nfor other learners and hypothesis spaces as well. A lazy version of BACKPROPAGA- \\nTION, for example, could learn a different neural network for each distinct query \\npoint, compared to the eager version of BACKPROPAGATION discussed in Chapter 4. \\nThe key point in the above paragraph is that a lazy learner has the option \\nof (implicitly) representing the target function by a combination of many local \\napproximations, whereas an eager learner must commit at training time to a single \\nglobal approximation. The distinction between eager and lazy learning is thus \\nrelated to the distinction between global and local approximations to the target \\nfunction. \\nCan we create eager methods that use multiple local approximations to \\nachieve the same effects as lazy local methods? Radial basis function networks can \\nbe seen as one attempt to achieve this. The RBF learning methods we discussed \\nare eager methods that commit to a global approximation to the target function \\nat training time. However, an RBF network represents this global function as a \\nlinear combination of multiple local kernel functions. Nevertheless, because RBF \\nlearning methods must commit to the hypothesis before the query point is known, \\nthe local approximations they create are not specifically targeted to the query \\npoint to the same degree as in a lazy learning method. Instead, RBF networks are \\nbuilt eagerly from local approximations centered around the training examples, or \\naround clusters of training examples, but not around the unknown future query \\npoints. \\nTo summarize, lazy methods have the option of selecting a different hypoth- \\nesis or local approximation to the target function for each query instance. Eager \\nmethods using the same hypothesis space are more restricted because they must \\ncommit to a single hypothesis that covers the entire instance space. Eager methods \\ncan, of course, employ hypothesis spaces that combine multiple local approxima- \\ntions, as in RBF networks. However, even these combined local approximations do \\nnot give eager methods the full ability of lazy methods to customize to unknown \\nfuture query instances. \\n8.7 SUMMARY AND FURTHER READING \\nThe main points of this chapter include: \\nInstance-based learning methods differ from other approaches to function ap- \\nproximation because they delay processing of training examples until they \\nmust label a new query instance. As a result, they need not form an explicit \\nhypothesis of the entire target function over the entire instance space, in- \\ndependent of the query instance. Instead, they may form a different local \\napproximation to the target function for each query instance.'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'macOS Version 11.2.3 (Build 20D91) Quartz PDFContext', 'creator': 'Preview', 'creationdate': \"D:20210312135113Z00'00'\", 'title': 'Machine - Learning - Tom Mitchell.pdf', 'moddate': \"D:20210312135113Z00'00'\", 'source': '..\\\\Data\\\\PDFiles\\\\MachineLearningTomMitchell.pdf', 'total_pages': 421, 'page': 257, 'page_label': '258'}, page_content='246 MACHINE LEARNING \\n1 \\n0 Advantages of instance-based methods include the ability to model complex \\ntarget functions by a collection of less complex local approximations and the \\nfact that information present in the training examples is never lost (because \\nthe examples themselves are stored explicitly). The main practical difficul- \\nties include efficiency of labeling new instances (all processing is done at \\nquery time rather than in advance), difficulties in determining an appropriate \\ndistance metric for retrieving \"related\" instances (especially when examples \\nare represented by complex symbolic descriptions), and the negative impact \\nof irrelevant features on the distance metric. \\n0 k-NEAREST NEIGHBOR is an instance-based algorithm for approximating real- \\nvalued or discrete-valued target functions, assuming instances correspond to \\npoints in an n-dimensional Euclidean space. The target function value for \\na new query is estimated from the known values of the k nearest training \\nexamples. \\n0 Locally weighted regression methods are a generalization of k-NEAREST \\nNEIGHBOR in which an explicit local approximation to the target function \\nis constructed for each query instance. The local approximation to the target \\nfunction may be based on a variety of functional forms such as constant, \\nlinear, or quadratic functions or on spatially localized kernel functions. \\n0 Radial basis function (RBF) networks are a type of artificial neural network \\nconstructed from spatially localized kernel functions. These can be seen as a \\nblend of instance-based approaches (spatially localized influence of each ker- \\nnel function) and neural network approaches (a global approximation to the \\ntarget function is formed at training time rather than a local approximation \\nat query time). Radial basis function networks have been used successfully \\nin applications such as interpreting visual scenes, in which the assumption \\nof spatially local influences is well-justified. \\n0 Case-based reasoning is an instance-based approach in which instances are \\nrepresented by complex logical descriptions rather than points in a Euclidean \\nspace. Given these complex symbolic descriptions of instances, a rich variety \\nof methods have been proposed for mapping from the training examples to \\ntarget function values for new instances. Case-based reasoning methods have \\nbeen used in applications such as modeling legal reasoning and for guiding \\nsearches in complex manufacturing and transportation planning problems. \\nThe k-NEAREST NEIGHBOR algorithm is one of the most thoroughly analyzed \\nalgorithms in machine learning, due in part to its age and in part to its simplicity. \\nCover and Hart (1967) present early theoretical results, and Duda and Hart (1973) \\nprovide a good overview.

Hypotheses are often described by bit strings whose interpretation depends \\non the application, though hypotheses may also be described by symbolic expressions \\nor even computer programs. The search for an appropriate hypothesis begins with a \\npopulation, or collection, of initial hypotheses. Members of the current population \\ngive rise to the next generation population by means of operations such as random \\nmutation and crossover, which are patterned after processes in biological evolution. \\nAt each step, the hypotheses in the current population are evaluated relative to \\na given measure of fitness, with the most fit hypotheses selected probabilistically \\nas seeds for producing the next generation. Genetic algorithms have been applied \\nsuccessfully to a variety of learning tasks and to other optimization problems.

We also describe a variant \\ncalled genetic programming, in which entire computer programs are evolved to \\ncertain fitness criteria. Genetic algorithms and genetic programming are two of \\nthe more popular approaches in a field that is sometimes called evolutionary \\ncomputation. In the final section we touch on selected topics in the study of \\nbiological evolution, including the Baldwin effect, which describes an interesting \\ninterplay between the learning capabilities of single individuals and the rate of \\nevolution of the entire population. \\n9.2 GENETIC ALGORITHMS - \\nThe problem addressed by GAS is to search a space of candidate hypotheses to \\nidentify the best hypothesis. In GAS the \"best hypothesis\" is defined as the one \\nthat optimizes a predefined numerical measure for the problem at hand, called the \\nhypothesis Jitness. For example, if the learning task is the problem of approxi- \\nmating an unknown function given training examples of its input and output, then \\nfitness could be defined as the accuracy of the hypothesis over this training data. \\nIf the task is to learn a strategy for playing chess, fitness could be defined as the \\nnumber of games won by the individual when playing against other individuals \\nin the current population. \\nAlthough different implementations of genetic algorithms vary in their de- \\ntails, they typically share the following structure: The algorithm operates by itera- \\ntively updating a pool of hypotheses, called the population. On each iteration, all \\nmembers of the population are evaluated according to the fitness function. A new \\npopulation is then generated by probabilistically selecting the most fit individuals \\nfrom the current population. Some of these selected individuals are carried forward \\ninto the next generation population intact. Others are used as the basis for creating \\nnew offspring individuals by applying genetic operations such as crossover and \\nmutation.'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'macOS Version 11.2.3 (Build 20D91) Quartz PDFContext', 'creator': 'Preview', 'creationdate': \"D:20210312135113Z00'00'\", 'title': 'Machine - Learning - Tom Mitchell.pdf', 'moddate': \"D:20210312135113Z00'00'\", 'source': '..\\\\Data\\\\PDFiles\\\\MachineLearningTomMitchell.pdf', 'total_pages': 421, 'page': 262, 'page_label': '263'}, page_content=\"Fitness: A function that assigns an evaluation score, given a hypothesis. \\nFitnessdhreshold: A threshold specifying the termination criterion. \\np: The number of hypotheses to be included in the population. \\nr: The fraction of the population to be replaced by Crossover at each step. \\nm: The mutation rate. \\nInitialize population: P c Generate p hypotheses at random \\nEvaluate: For each h in P, compute Fitness(h)' \\nWhile [max Fitness(h)] < Fitnessdhreshold do \\nh \\nCreate a new generation, Ps: \\n1.

In the follow- \\ning subsections, we describe in more detail the representation of hypotheses and \\ngenetic operators used in this algorithm. \\n9.2.1 Representing Hypotheses \\nHypotheses in GAS are often represented by bit strings, so that they can be easily \\nmanipulated by genetic operators such as mutation and crossover. The hypotheses \\nrepresented by these bit strings can be quite complex. For example, sets of if-then \\nrules can easily be represented in this way, by choosing an encoding of rules \\nthat allocates specific substrings for each rule precondition and postcondition. \\nExamples of such rule representations in GA systems are described by Holland \\n(1986); Grefenstette (1988); and DeJong et al. (1993). \\nTo see how if-then rules can be encoded by bit strings, .first consider how we \\nmight use a bit string to describe a constraint on the value of a single attribute. To \\npick an example, consider the attribute Outlook, which can take on any of the three \\nvalues Sunny, Overcast, or Rain. One obvious way to represent a constraint on \\nOutlook is to use a bit string of length three, in which each bit position corresponds \\nto one of its three possible values. Placing a 1 in some position indicates that the \\nattribute is allowed to take on the corresponding value. For example, the string 010 \\nrepresents the constraint that Outlook must take on the second of these values, , \\nor Outlook = Overcast. Similarly, the string 011 represents the more general \\nconstraint that allows two possible values, or (Outlook = Overcast v Rain). \\nNote 11 1 represents the most general possible constraint, indicating that we don't \\ncare which of its possible values the attribute takes on. \\nGiven this method for representing constraints on a single attribute, con- \\njunctions of constraints on multiple attributes can easily be represented by con- \\ncatenating the corresponding bit strings. For example, consider a second attribute, \\nWind, that can take on the value Strong or Weak.

Thus, an entire rule can be described by concatenating the bit \\nstrings describing the rule preconditions, together with the bit string describing \\nthe rule postcondition. For example, the rule \\nIF Wind = Strong THEN PlayTennis = yes \\nwould be represented by the string \\nOutlook Wind PlayTennis \\n111 10 10 \\nwhere the first three bits describe the \"don\\'t care\" constraint on Outlook, the next \\ntwo bits describe the constraint on Wind, and the final two bits describe the rule \\npostcondition (here we assume PlayTennis can take on the values Yes or No). \\nNote the bit string representing the rule contains a substring for each attribute \\nin the hypothesis space, even if that attribute is not constrained by the rule pre- \\nconditions. This yields a fixed length bit-string representation for rules, in which \\nsubstrings at specific locations describe constraints on specific attributes. Given \\nthis representation for single rules, we can represent sets of rules by similarly \\nconcatenating the bit string representations of the individual rules. \\nIn designing a bit string encoding for some hypothesis space, it is useful to \\narrange for every syntactically legal bit string to represent a well-defined hypoth- \\nesis. To illustrate, note in the rule encoding in the above paragraph the bit string \\n11 1 10 11 represents a rule whose postcondition does not constrain the target \\nattribute PlayTennis. If we wish to avoid considering this hypothesis, we may \\nemploy a different encoding (e.g., allocate just one bit to the PlayTennis post- \\ncondition to indicate whether the value is Yes or No), alter the genetic operators \\nso that they explicitly avoid constructing such bit strings, or simply assign a very \\nlow fitness to such bit strings. \\nIn some GAS, hypotheses are represented by symbolic descriptions rather \\nthan bit strings. For example, in Section 9.5 we discuss a genetic algorithm that \\nencodes hypotheses as computer programs. \\n9.2.2 Genetic Operators \\nThe generation of successors in a GA is determined by a set of operators that \\nrecombine and mutate selected members of the current population.

To illustrate, consider the single-point crossover operator at \\nthe top of Table 9.2. Consider the topmost of the two offspring in this case.

If \\nthe task is to learn classification rules, then the fitness function typically has a \\ncomponent that scores the classification accuracy of the rule over a set of provided \\ntraining examples. Often other criteria may be included as well, such as the com- \\nplexity or generality of the rule. More generally, when the bit-string hypothesis is \\ninterpreted as a complex procedure (e.g., when the bit string represents a collec- \\ntion of if-then rules that will be chained together to control a robotic device), the \\nfitness function may measure the overall performance of the resulting procedure \\nrather than performance of individual rules. \\nIn our prototypical GA shown in Table 9.1, the probability that a hypothesis \\nwill be selected is given by the ratio of its fitness to the fitness of other members \\nof the current population as seen in Equation (9.1). This method is sometimes \\ncalled jitness proportionate selection, or roulette wheel selection. Other methods \\nfor using fitness to select hypotheses have also been proposed.

Although not guaranteed to find an optimal object, GAS often \\nsucceed in finding an object with high fitness. GAS have been applied to a number \\nof optimization problems outside machine learning, including problems such as \\ncircuit layout and job-shop scheduling. Within machine learning, they have been \\napplied both to function-approximation problems and to tasks such as choosing \\nthe network topology for artificial neural network learning systems. \\nTo illustrate the use of GAS for concept learning, we briefly summarize \\nthe GABIL system described by DeJong et al. (1993). GABIL uses a GA to \\nlearn boolean concepts represented by a disjunctive set of propositional rules. \\nIn experiments over several concept learning problems, GABIL was found to be \\nroughly comparable in generalization accuracy to other learning algorithms such \\nas the decision tree learning algorithm C4.5 and the rule learning system AQ14. \\nThe learning tasks in this study included both artificial learning tasks designed to \\nexplore the systems' generalization accuracy and the real world problem of breast \\ncancer diagnosis. \\nThe algorithm used by GABIL is exactly the algorithm described in Ta- \\nble 9.1. In experiments reported by DeJong et al. (1993), the parameter r, which \\ndetermines the fraction of the parent population replaced by crossover, was set \\nto 0.6. The parameter m, which determines the mutation rate, was set to 0.001. \\nThese are typical settings for these parameters. The population size p was varied \\nfrom 100 to 1000, depending on the specific learning task. \\nThe specific instantiation of the GA algorithm in GABIL can be summarized \\nas follows: \\n0 Representation. Each hypothesis in GABIL corresponds to a disjunctive set \\nof propositional rules, encoded as described in Section 9.2.1.

(1993) also explore two interesting extensions to the basic design \\nof GABIL. In one set of experiments they explored the addition of two new ge- \\nnetic operators that were motivated by the generalization operators common in \\nmany symbolic learning methods. The first of these operators, AddAlternative, \\ngeneralizes the constraint on a specific attribute by changing a 0 to a 1 in the \\nsubstring corresponding to the attribute. For example, if the constraint on an at- \\ntribute is represented by the string 10010, this operator might change it to 101 10. \\nThis operator was applied with probability .O1 to selected members of the popu- \\nlation on each generation. The second operator, Dropcondition performs a more \\ndrastic generalization step, by replacing all bits for a particular attribute by a 1. \\nThis operator corresponds to generalizing the rule by completely dropping the \\nconstraint on the attribute, and was applied on each generation with probability \\n.60.

This search is quite different from that of other learning \\nmethods we have considered in this book. To contrast the hypothesis space search \\nof GAS with that of neural network BACKPROPAGATION, for example, the gradient \\ndescent search in BACKPROPAGATION moves smoothly from one hypothesis to a \\nnew hypothesis that is very similar. In contrast, the GA search can move much \\nmore abruptly, replacing a parent hypothesis by an offspring that may be radically \\ndifferent from the parent. Note the GA search is therefore less likely to fall into \\nthe same kind of local minima that can plague gradient descent methods. \\nOne practical difficulty in some GA applications is the problem of crowding. \\nCrowding is a phenomenon in which some individual that is more highly fit than \\nothers in the population quickly reproduces, so that copies of this individual and \\n1 very similar individuals take over a large fraction of the population. The negative \\nimpact of crowding is that it reduces the diversity of the population, thereby slow- \\ning further progress by the GA. Several strategies have been explored for reducing \\ncrowding. One approach is to alter the selection function, using criteria such as \\ntournament selection or rank selection in place of fitness proportionate roulette \\nwheel selection.

The schema theorem of Holland (1975) \\nprovides one such characterization. It is based on the concept of schemas, or pat- \\nterns that describe sets of bit strings. To be precise, a schema is any string com- \\nposed of Os, Is, and *\\'s. Each schema represents the set of bit strings containing the \\nindicated 0s and Is, with each \"*\" interpreted as a \"don\\'t care.\" For example, the \\nschema 0*10 represents the set of bit strings that includes exactly 0010 and 01 10. \\nAn individual bit string can be viewed as a representative of each of the \\ndifferent schemas that it matches. For example, the bit string 0010 can be thought \\nof as a representative of 24 distinct schemas including 00**, O* 10, ****, etc. Sim- \\nilarly, a population of bit strings can be viewed in terms of the set of schemas that \\nit represents and the number of individuals associated with each of these schema. \\nThe schema theorem characterizes the evolution of the population within a \\nGA in terms of the number of instances representing each schema. Let m(s, t) \\ndenote the number of instances of schema s in the population at time t (i.e., \\nduring the tth generation). The schema theorem describes the expected value of \\nm(s, t + 1) in terms of m(s, t) and other properties of the schema, population, and \\nGA algorithm parameters. \\nThe evolution of the population in the GA depends on the selection step, \\nthe recombination step, and the mutation step. Let us start by considering just the \\neffect of the selection step. Let f (h) denote the fitness of the individual bit string \\nh and f(t) denote the average fitness of all individuals in the population at time t. \\nLet n be the total number of individuals in the population. Let h E s n p, indicate \\nthat the individual h is both a representative of schema s and a member of the \\npopulation at time t. Finally, let 2(s, t) denote the average fitness of instances of \\nschema s in the population at time t. \\nWe are interested in calculating the expected value of m(s, t + l), which \\nwe denote E[m(s, t + I)]. We can calculate E[m (s, t + I)] using the probability \\ndistribution for selection given in Equation (9. I), which can be restated using our \\ncurrent terminology as follows: \\nNow if we select one member for the new population according to this probability \\ndistribution, then the probability that we will select a representative of schema s is'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'macOS Version 11.2.3 (Build 20D91) Quartz PDFContext', 'creator': 'Preview', 'creationdate': \"D:20210312135113Z00'00'\", 'title': 'Machine - Learning - Tom Mitchell.pdf', 'moddate': \"D:20210312135113Z00'00'\", 'source': '..\\\\Data\\\\PDFiles\\\\MachineLearningTomMitchell.pdf', 'total_pages': 421, 'page': 272, 'page_label': '273'}, page_content='The second step above follows from the fact that by definition, \\nEquation (9.2) gives the probability that a single hypothesis selected by the GA \\nwill be an instance of schema s.

The rightmost term describes the probability that an arbitrary individual \\nrepresenting schema s will still represent schema s following application of the \\nmutation operator. Note that the effects of single-point crossover and mutation \\nincrease with the number of defined bits o(s) in the schema and with the distance \\nd(s) between the defined bits.

Each function call is represented by a \\nnode in the tree, and the arguments to the function are given by its descendant \\nnodes. For example, Figure 9.1 illustrates this tree representation for the function \\nsin(x) + J-. To apply genetic programming to a particular domain, the user \\nmust define the primitive functions to be considered (e.g., sin, cos, J, +, -, ex- \\nponential~), as well as the terminals (e.g., x, y, constants such as 2). The genetic \\nprogramming algorithm then uses an evolutionary search to explore the vast space \\nof programs that can be described using these primitives. \\nAs in a genetic algorithm, the prototypical genetic programming algorithm \\nmaintains a population of individuals (in this case, program trees). On each it- \\neration, it produces a new generation of individuals using selection, crossover, \\nand mutation. The fitness of a given individual program in the population is typ- \\nically determined by executing the program on a set of training data.

A comparison of GP \\nto other methods for searching through the space of computer programs, such as \\nhillclimbing and simulated annealing, is given by O\\'Reilly and Oppacher (1994). \\nWhile the above example of GP search is fairly simple, Koza et al. (1996) \\nsummarize the use of a GP in several more complex tasks such as designing \\nelectronic filter circuits and classifying segments of protein molecules. The fil- \\nter circuit design problem provides an example of a considerably more complex \\nproblem. Here, programs are evolved that transform a simple fixed seed circuit \\ninto a final circuit design. The primitive functions used by the GP to construct its \\nprograms are functions that edit the seed circuit by inserting or deleting circuit \\ncomponents and wiring connections. The fitness of each program is calculated \\nby simulating the circuit it outputs (using the SPICE circuit simulator) to de- \\ntermine how closely this circuit meets the design specifications for the desired \\nfilter.

At the same time, biological and social processes allow their species \\nto adapt over a time frame of many generations. One interesting question regarding \\nevolutionary systems is \"What is the relationship between learning during the \\nlifetime of a single individual, and the longer time frame species-level learning \\nafforded by evolution?\\' \\n9.6.1 Lamarckian Evolution \\nLarnarck was a scientist who, in the late nineteenth century, proposed that evo- \\nlution over many generations was directly influenced by the experiences of indi- \\nvidual organisms during their lifetime. In particular, he proposed that experiences \\nof a single organism directly affected the genetic makeup of their offspring: If \\nan individual learned during its lifetime to avoid some toxic food, it could pass \\nthis trait on genetically to its offspring, which therefore would not need to learn \\nthe trait. This is an attractive conjecture, because it would presumably allow for \\nmore efficient evolutionary progress than a generate-and-test process (like that of \\nGAS and GPs) that ignores the experience gained during an individual\\'s lifetime. \\nDespite the attractiveness of this theory, current scientific evidence overwhelm- \\ningly contradicts Lamarck\\'s model. The currently accepted view is that the genetic \\nmakeup of an individual is, in fact, unaffected by the lifetime experience of one\\'s \\nbiological parents. Despite this apparent biological fact, recent computer studies \\nhave shown that Lamarckian processes can sometimes improve the effectiveness \\nof computerized genetic algorithms (see Grefenstette 1991; Ackley and Littman \\n1994; and Hart and Belew 1995).'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'macOS Version 11.2.3 (Build 20D91) Quartz PDFContext', 'creator': 'Preview', 'creationdate': \"D:20210312135113Z00'00'\", 'title': 'Machine - Learning - Tom Mitchell.pdf', 'moddate': \"D:20210312135113Z00'00'\", 'source': '..\\\\Data\\\\PDFiles\\\\MachineLearningTomMitchell.pdf', 'total_pages': 421, 'page': 278, 'page_label': '279'}, page_content='9.6.2 Baldwin Effect \\nAlthough Lamarckian evolution is not an accepted model of biological evolution, \\nother mechanisms have been suggested by which individual learning can alter \\nthe course of evolution. One such mechanism is called the Baldwin effect, after \\nJ. M. Baldwin (1896), who first suggested the idea. The Baldwin effect is based \\non the following observations: \\n0 If a species is evolving in a changing environment, there will be evolution- \\nary pressure to favor individuals with the capability to learn during their \\nlifetime. For example, if a new predator appears in the environment, then \\nindividuals capable of learning to avoid the predator will be more successful \\nthan individuals who cannot learn. In effect, the ability to learn allows an \\nindividual to perform a small local search during its lifetime to maximize its \\nfitness. In contrast, nonlearning individuals whose fitness is fully determined \\nby their genetic makeup will operate at a relative disadvantage. \\n0 Those individuals who are able to learn many traits will rely less strongly \\non their genetic code to \"hard-wire\" traits. As a result, these individuals \\ncan support a more diverse gene pool, relying on individual learning to \\novercome the \"missing\" or \"not quite optimized\" traits in the genetic code. \\nThis more diverse gene pool can, in turn, support more rapid evolutionary \\nadaptation. Thus, the ability of individuals to learn can have an indirect \\naccelerating effect on the rate of evolutionary adaptation for the entire pop- \\nulation. \\nTo illustrate, imagine some new change in the environment of some species, \\nsuch as a new predator. Such a change will selectively favor individuals capa- \\nble of learning to avoid the predator. As the proportion of such self-improving \\nindividuals in the population grows, the population will be able to support a \\nmore diverse gene pool, allowing evolutionary processes (even non-Lamarckian \\ngenerate-and-test processes) to adapt more rapidly. This accelerated adaptation \\nmay in turn enable standard evolutionary processes to more quickly evolve a \\ngenetic (nonlearned) trait to avoid the predator (e.g., an instinctive fear of this \\nanimal). Thus, the Baldwin effect provides an indirect mechanism for individ- \\nual learning to positively impact the rate of evolutionary progress. By increas- \\ning survivability and genetic diversity of the species, individual learning sup- \\nports more rapid evolutionary progress, thereby increasing the chance that the \\nspecies will evolve genetic, nonlearned traits that better fit the new environ- \\nment. \\nThere have been several attempts to develop computational models to study \\nthe Baldwin effect. For example, Hinton and Nowlan (1987) experimented with \\nevolving a population of simple neural networks, in which some network weights \\nwere fixed during the individual network \"lifetime,\" while others were trainable. \\nThe genetic makeup of the individual determined which weights were train- \\nable and which were fixed.

However, \\nwhen individual learning was allowed, the population quickly improved its fit- \\nness. During early generations of evolution the population contained a greater \\nproportion of individuals with many trainable weights. However, as evolution \\nproceeded, the number of fixed, correct network weights tended to increase, as \\nthe population evolved toward genetically given weight values and toward less \\ndependence on individual learning of weights. Additional computational stud- \\nies of the Baldwin effect have been reported by Belew (1990), Harvey (1993), \\nand French and Messinger (1994). An excellent overview of this topic can be \\nfound in Mitchell (1996). A special issue of the journal Evolutionary Computa- \\ntion on this topic (Turney et al. 1997) contains several articles on the Baldwin \\neffect. \\n9.7 PARALLELIZING GENETIC ALGORITHMS \\nGAS are naturally suited to parallel implementation, and a number of approaches \\nto parallelization have been explored. Coarse grain approaches to paralleliza- \\ntion subdivide the population into somewhat distinct groups of individuals, called \\ndemes. Each deme is assigned to a different computational node, and a standard \\nGA search is performed at each node. Communication and cross-fertilization be- \\ntween demes occurs on a less frequent basis than within demes. Transfer between \\ndemes occurs by a migration process, in which individuals from one deme are \\ncopied or transferred to other demes. This process is modeled after the kind of \\ncross-fertilization that might occur between physically separated subpopulations \\nof biological species. One benefit of such approaches is that it reduces the crowd- \\ning problem often encountered in nonparallel GAS, in which the system falls into \\na local optimum due to the early appearance of a genotype that comes to dominate \\nthe entire population. Examples of coarse-grained parallel GAS are described by \\nTanese (1989) and by Cohoon et al. (1987). \\nIn contrast to coarse-grained parallel implementations of GAS, fine-grained \\nimplementations typically assign one processor per individual in the population. \\nRecombination then takes place among neighboring individuals. Several differ- \\nent types of neighborhoods have been proposed, ranging from planar grid to \\ntorus. Examples of such systems are described by Spiessens and Manderick \\n(1991). An edited collection of papers on parallel GAS is available in Stender \\n(1993). \\n9.8 SUMMARY AND FURTHER READING \\nThe main points of this chapter include: \\n0 Genetic algorithms (GAS) conduct a randomized, parallel, hill-climbing \\nsearch for hypotheses that optimize a predefined fitness function. \\n0 The search performed by GAS is based on an analogy to biological evolu- \\ntion.

Several \\ndifferent evolutionary approaches were introduced during the 1960s and have \\nbeen further explored since that time. Evolution strategies, developed by Rechen- \\nberg (1965, 1973) to optimize numerical parameters in engineering design, were \\nfollowed up by Schwefel (1975, 1977, 1995) and others. Evolutionary program- \\nming, developed by Folgel, Owens, and Walsh (1966) as a method for evolv- \\ning finite-state machines, was followed up by numerous researchers (e.g., \\nFogel and Atmar 1993). Genetic algorithms, introduced by Holland (1962, 1975) \\nincluded the notion of maintaining a large population of individuals and em- \\nphasized crossover as a key operation in such systems.

This chapter explores several algorithms for learning such \\nsets of rules. One important special case involves learning sets of rules containing \\nvariables, called first-order Horn clauses. Because sets of first-order Horn clauses \\ncan be interpreted as programs in the logic programming language PROLOG, learning \\nthem is often called inductive logic programming (ILP). This chapter examines sev- \\neral approaches to learning sets of rules, including an approach based on inverting \\nthe deductive operators of mechanical theorem provers. \\n10.1 INTRODUCTION \\nIn many cases it is useful to learn the target function represented as a set of \\nif-then rules that jointly define the function. As shown in Chapter 3, one way to \\nlearn sets of rules is to first learn a decision tree, then translate the tree into an \\nequivalent set of rules-one rule for each leaf node in the tree. A second method, \\nillustrated in Chapter 9, is to use a genetic algorithm that encodes each rule set \\nas a bit string and uses genetic search operators to explore this hypothesis space. \\nIn this chapter we explore a variety of algorithms that directly learn rule sets and \\nthat differ from these algorithms in two key respects. First, they are designed to \\nlearn sets of first-order rules that contain variables. This is significant because \\nfirst-order rules are much more expressive than propositional rules.

In PROLOG, programs are sets of \\nfirst-order rules such as the two shown above (rules of this form are also called \\nHorn clauses). In fact, when stated in a slightly different syntax the above rules \\nform a valid PROLOG program for computing the Ancestor relation. In this light, \\na general purpose algorithm capable of learning such rule sets may be viewed \\nas an algorithm for automatically inferring PROLOG programs from examples. In \\nthis chapter we explore learning algorithms capable of learning such rules, given \\nappropriate sets of training examples. \\nIn practice, learning systems based on first-order representations have been \\nsuccessfully applied to problems such as learning which chemical bonds fragment \\nin a mass spectrometer (Buchanan 1976; Lindsay 1980), learning which chemical \\nsubstructures produce mutagenic activity (a property related to carcinogenicity) \\n(Srinivasan et al. 1994), and learning to design finite element meshes to analyze \\nstresses in physical structures (Dolsak and Muggleton 1992). In each of these \\napplications, the hypotheses that must be represented involve relational assertions \\nthat can be conveniently expressed using first-order representations, while they \\nare very difficult to describe using propositional representations. \\nIn this chapter we begin by considering algorithms that learn sets of propo- \\nsitional rules; that is, rules without variables. Algorithms for searching the hy- \\npothesis space to learn disjunctive sets of rules are most easily understood in \\nthis setting. We then consider extensions of these algorithms to learn first-order \\nrules. Two general approaches to inductive logic programming are then consid- \\nered, and the fundamental relationship between inductive and deductive inference \\nis explored. \\n10.2 SEQUENTIAL COVERING ALGORITHMS \\nHere we consider a family of algorithms for learning rule sets based on the strategy \\nof learning one rule, removing the data it covers, then iterating this process. Such \\nalgorithms are called sequential covering algorithms.

We require that this iaarput \\nrule have high accuracy, but not necessarily high coverage. By high accuracy, we \\nmean the predictions it makes should be correct. By accepting low coverage, we \\nmean it need not make predictions for every training example. \\nGiven this LEARN-ONE-RULE subroutine for learning a single rule, one obvi- \\nous approach to learning a set of rules is to invoke LEARN-ONE-RULE on all the \\navailable training examples, remove any positive examples covered by the rule it \\nlearns, then invoke it again to learn a second rule based on the remaining train- \\ning examples. This procedure can be iterated as many times as desired to learn \\na disjunctive set of rules that together cover any desired fraction of the positive \\nexamples. This is called a sequential covering algorithm because it sequentially \\nlearns a set of rules that together cover the full set of positive examples. The \\nfinal set of rules can then be sorted so that more accurate rules will be considered \\nfirst when a new instance must be classified. A prototypical sequential covering \\nalgorithm is described in Table 10.1. \\nThis sequential covering algorithm is one of the most widespread approaches \\nto learning disjunctive sets of rules. It reduces the problem of learning a disjunc- \\ntive set of rules to a sequence of simpler problems, each requiring that a single \\nconjunctive rule be learned. Because it performs a greedy search, formulating a \\nsequence of rules without backtracking, it is not guaranteed to find the smallest \\nor best set of rules that cover the training examples. \\nHow shall we design LEARN-ONE-RULE to meet the needs of the sequential \\ncovering algorithm? We require an algorithm that can formulate a single rule \\nwith high accuracy, but that need not cover all of the positive examples. In this \\nsection we present a variety of algorithms and describe the main variations that \\nhave been explored in the research literature.

As illustrated in the \\nsearch tree of Figure 10.1, the search begins by considering the most general rule \\nprecondition possible (the empty test that matches every instance), then greed- \\nily adding the attribute test that most improves rule performance measured over \\nthe training examples. Once this test has been added, the process is repeated by \\ngreedily adding a second attribute test, and so on. Like ID3, this process grows the \\nhypothesis by greedily adding new attribute tests until the hypothesis reaches an \\nacceptable level of performance. Unlike ID3, this implementation of LEARN-ONE- \\nRULE follows only a single descendant at each search step-the attribute-value \\npair yielding the best performance-rather than growing a subtree that covers all \\npossible values of the selected attribute. \\nThis approach to implementing LEARN-ONE-RULE performs a general-to- \\nspecific search through the space of possible rules in search of a rule with high \\naccuracy, though perhaps incomplete coverage of the data. As in decision tree \\nlearning, there are many ways to define a measure to select the \"best\" descendant. \\nTo follow the lead of ID3 let us for now define the best descendant as the one \\nwhose covered examples have the lowest entropy (recall Equation f3.31). \\nThe general-to-specific search suggested above for the LEARN-ONE-RULE al- \\ngorithm is a greedy depth-first search with no backtracking.

Each of these conjunctive hypotheses \\ncorresponds to a candidate set of preconditions for the rule to be learned and is \\nevaluated by the entropy of the examples it covers. The search considers increas- \\ningly specific candidate hypotheses until it reaches a maximally specific hypothesis \\nthat contains all available attributes. The rule that is output by the algorithm is the \\nrule encountered during the search whose PERFORMANCE is greatest-not necessar- \\nily the final hypothesis generated in the search. The postcondition for the output \\nrule is chosen only in the final step of the algorithm, after its precondition (rep- \\nresented by the variable Besthypothesis) has been determined. The algorithm \\nconstructs the rule postcondition to predict the value of the target attribute that \\nis most common among the examples covered by the rule precondition. Finally, \\nnote that despite the use of beam search to reduce the risk, the greedy search may \\nstill produce suboptimal rules. However, even when this occurs the SEQUENTIAL- \\nCOVERING algorithm can still learn a collection of rules that together cover the \\ntraining examples, because it repeatedly calls LEARN-ONE-RULE on the remaining \\nuncovered examples. \\n10.2.2 Variations \\nThe SEQUENTIAL-COVERING algorithm, together with the LEARN-ONE-RULE algo- \\nrithm, learns a set of if-then rules that covers the training examples. Many varia- \\ntions on this approach have been explored. For example, in some cases it might \\nbe desirable to have the program learn only rules that cover positive examples \\nand to include a \"default\" that assigns a negative classification to instances not \\ncovered by any rule. This approach might be desirable, say, if one is attempting \\nto learn a target concept such as \"pregnant women who are likely to have twins.\" \\nIn this case, the fraction of positive examples in the entire population is small, so \\nthe rule set will be more compact and intelligible to humans if it identifies only \\nclasses of positive examples, with the default classification of all other examples \\nas negative. This approach also corresponds to the \"negation-as-failure\" strategy \\nof PROLOG, in which any expression that cannot be proven to be true is by default \\nassumed to be false. In order to learn such rules that predict just a single target \\nvalue, the LEARN-ONE-RULE algorithm can be modified to accept an additional in- \\nput argument specifying the target value of interest.

Like CN2, AQ learns a disjunctive set of rules that \\ntogether cover the target function. However, AQ differs in several ways from \\nthe algorithms given here. First, the covering algorithm of AQ differs from the \\nSEQUENTIAL-COVERING algorithm because it explicitly seeks rules that cover a par- \\nticular target value, learning a disjunctive set of rules for each target value in \\nturn. Second, AQ\\'s algorithm for learning a single rule differs from LEARN-ONE- \\nRULE. While it conducts a general-to-specific beam search for each rule, it uses a \\nsingle positive example to focus this search. In particular, it considers only those \\nattributes satisfied by the positive example as it searches for progressively more \\nspecific hypotheses. Each time it learns a new rule it selects a new positive ex- \\nample from those that are not yet covered, to act as a seed to guide the search for \\nthis new disjunct. \\n10.3 LEARNING RULE SETS: SUMMARY \\nThe SEQUENTIAL-COVERING algorithm described above and the decision tree learn- \\ning algorithms of Chapter 3 suggest a variety of possible methods for learning \\nsets of rules. This section considers several key dimensions in the design space \\nof such rule learning algorithms. \\nFirst, sequential covering algorithms learn one rule at a time, removing \\nthe covered examples and repeating the process on the remaining examples. In \\ncontrast, decision tree algorithms such as ID3 learn the entire set of disjuncts \\nsimultaneously as part of the single search for an acceptable decision tree. We \\nmight, therefore, call algorithms such as ID3 simultaneous covering algorithms, in \\ncontrast to sequential covering algorithms such as CN2. Which should we prefer? \\nThe key difference occurs in the choice made at the most primitive step in the \\nsearch. At each search step ID3 chooses among alternative attributes by com- \\nparing the partitions of the data they generate. In contrast, CN2 chooses among \\nalternative attribute-value pairs, by comparing the subsets of data they cover. \\nOne way to see the significance of this difference is to compare the number of \\ndistinct choices made by the two algorithms in order to learn the same set of \\nrules. To learn a set of n rules, each containing k attribute-value tests in their \\npreconditions, sequential covering algorithms will perform n . k primitive search \\nsteps, making an independent decision to select each precondition of each rule. \\nIn contrast, simultaneous covering algorithms will make many fewer independent \\nchoices, because each choice of a decision node in the decision tree corresponds \\nto choosing the precondition for the multiple rules associated with that node. In \\nother words, if the decision node tests an attribute that has m possible values, the \\nchoice of the decision node corresponds to choosing a precondition for each of the \\nm corresponding rules (see Exercise 10.1). Thus, sequential covering algorithms \\nsuch as CN2 make a larger number of independent choices than simultaneous \\ncovering algorithms such as ID3. Still, the question remains, which should we \\nprefer? The answer may depend on how much training data is available. If data is \\nplentiful, then it may support the larger number of independent decisions required \\nby the sequential covering algorithm, whereas if data is scarce, the \"sharing\" of'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'macOS Version 11.2.3 (Build 20D91) Quartz PDFContext', 'creator': 'Preview', 'creationdate': \"D:20210312135113Z00'00'\", 'title': 'Machine - Learning - Tom Mitchell.pdf', 'moddate': \"D:20210312135113Z00'00'\", 'source': '..\\\\Data\\\\PDFiles\\\\MachineLearningTomMitchell.pdf', 'total_pages': 421, 'page': 292, 'page_label': '293'}, page_content='decisions regarding preconditions of different rules may be more effective. An \\nadditional consideration is the task-specific question of whether it is desirable \\nthat different rules test the same attributes. In the simultaneous covering deci- \\nsion tree learning algorithms, they will. In sequential covering algorithms, they \\nneed not. \\nA second dimension along which approaches vary is the direction of the \\nsearch in LEARN-ONE-RULE. In the algorithm described above, the search is from \\ngeneral to specijic hypotheses. Other algorithms we have discussed (e.g., FIND-S \\nfrom Chapter 2) search from specijic to general. One advantage of general to \\nspecific search in this case is that there is a single maximally general hypothesis \\nfrom which to begin the search, whereas there are very many specific hypotheses \\nin most hypothesis spaces (i.e., one for each possible instance). Given many \\nmaximally specific hypotheses, it is unclear which to select as the starting point of \\nthe search. One program that conducts a specific-to-general search, called GOLEM \\n(Muggleton and Feng 1990), addresses this issue by choosing several positive \\nexamples at random to initialize and to guide the search. The best hypothesis \\nobtained through multiple random choices is then selected. \\nA third dimension is whether the LEARN-ONE-RULE search is a generate then \\ntest search through the syntactically legal hypotheses, as it is in our suggested \\nimplementation, or whether it is example-driven so that individual training exam- \\nples constrain the generation of hypotheses. Prototypical example-driven search \\nalgorithms include the FIND-S and CANDIDATE-ELIMINATION algorithms of Chap- \\nter 2, the AQ algorithm, and the CIGOL algorithm discussed later in this chapter. \\nIn each of these algorithms, the generation or revision of hypotheses is driven \\nby the analysis of an individual training example, and the result is a revised \\nhypothesis designed to correct performance for this single example. This con- \\ntrasts to the generate and test search of LEARN-ONE-RULE in Table 10.2, in which \\nsuccessor hypotheses are generated based only on the syntax of the hypothesis \\nrepresentation. The training data is considered only after these candidate hypothe- \\nses are generated and is used to choose among the candidates based on their \\nperformance over the entire collection of training examples. One important ad- \\nvantage of the generate and test approach is that each choice in the search is \\nbased on the hypothesis performance over many examples, so that the impact \\nof noisy data is minimized. In contrast, example-driven algorithms that refine \\nthe hypothesis based on individual examples are more easily misled by a sin- \\ngle noisy training example and are therefore less robust to errors in the training \\ndata. \\nA fourth dimension is whether and how rules are post-pruned. As in decision \\ntree learning, it is possible for LEARN-ONE-RULE to formulate rules that perform \\nvery well on the training data, but less well on subsequent data. As in decision \\ntree learning, one way to address this issue is to post-prune each rule after it \\nis learned from the training data. In particular, preconditions can be removed \\nfrom the rule whenever this leads to improved performance over a set of pruning \\nexamples distinct from the training examples.

In this section, we consider learning rules that con- \\ntain variables-in particular, learning first-order Horn theories. Our motivation \\nfor considering such rules is that they are much more expressive than proposi- \\ntional rules. Inductive learning of first-order rules or theories is often referred to \\nas inductive logic programming (or LP for short), because this process can be \\nviewed as automatically inferring PROLOG programs from examples. PROLOG is a \\ngeneral purpose, Turing-equivalent programming language in which programs are \\nexpressed as collections of Horn clauses. \\n10.4.1 First-Order Horn Clauses \\nTo see the advantages of first-order representations over propositional (variable- \\nfree) representations, consider the task of learning the simple target concept \\nDaughter (x, y), defined over pairs of people x and y. The value of Daughter(x, y) \\nis True when x is the daughter of y, and False otherwise. Suppose each person \\nin the data is described by the attributes Name, Mother, Father, Male, Female. \\nHence, each training example will consist of the description of two people in \\nterms of these attributes, along with the value of the target attribute Daughter. \\nFor example, the following is a positive example in which Sharon is the daughter \\nof Bob: \\n(Namel = Sharon, Motherl = Louise, Fatherl = Bob, \\nMalel = False, Female1 = True, \\nName2 = Bob, Mother2 = Nora, Father2 = Victor, \\nMale2 = True, Female2 = False, Daughterl.2 = True) \\nwhere the subscript on each attribute name indicates which of the.two persons is \\nbeing described. Now if we were to collect a number of such training examples for \\nthe target concept Daughterlv2 and provide them to a propositional rule learner \\nsuch as CN2 or C4.5, the result would be a collection of very specific rules \\nsuch as \\nIF (Father1 = Bob) A (Name2 = Bob) A (Femalel = True) \\nTHEN  daughter^,^ = True \\nAlthough it is correct, this rule is so specific that it will rarely, if ever, be useful in \\nclassifying future pairs of people. The problem is that propositional representations \\noffer no general way to describe the essential relations among the values of the \\nattributes.

Whenever such a variable occurs only in the preconditions, \\nit is assumed to be existentially quantified; that is, the rule preconditions are \\nsatisfied as long as there exists at least one binding of the variable that satisfies \\nthe corresponding literal. \\nIt is also possible to use the same predicates in the rule postconditions and \\npreconditions, enabling the description of recursive rules. For example, the two \\nrules at the beginning of this chapter provide a recursive definition of the concept \\nAncestor (x, y). ILP learning methods such-as those described below have been \\ndemonstrated to learn a variety of simple recursive functions, such as the above \\nAncestor function, and functions for sorting the elements of a list, removing a \\nspecific element from a list, and appending two lists. \\nPOs4.2 Terminology \\nBefore moving on to algorithms for learning sets of Horn clauses, let us intro- \\nduce some basic terminology from formal logic. All expressions are composed \\nof constants (e.g., Bob, Louise), variables (e.g., x, y), predicate symbols (e.g., \\nMarried, Greater-Than), and function symbols (e.g., age). The difference be- \\ntween predicates and functions is that predicates take on values of True or False, \\nwhereas functions may take on any constant as their value. We will use lowercase \\nsymbols for variables and capitalized symbols for constants. Also, we will use \\nlowercase for functions and capitalized symbols for predicates. \\nFrom these symbols, we build up expressions as follows: A term is any con- \\nstant, any variable, or any function applied to any term (e.g., Bob, x, age(Bob)). \\nA literal is any predicate or its negation applied to any term (e.g., Married(Bob, \\nLouise), -Greater-Than(age(Sue), 20)). If a literal contains a negation (1) sym- \\nbol, we call it a negative literal, otherwise a positive literal. \\nA clause is any disjunction of literals, where all variables are assumed to be \\nuniversally quantified. A Horn clause is a clause containing at most one positive \\nliteral, such as \\nwhere H is the positive literal, and -Ll . . . -Ln are negative literals.

In fact, the FOIL program is the natural \\nextension of these earlier algorithms to first-order representations.

Second, FOIL rules are more expressive than Horn clauses, because the \\nliterals appearing in the body of the rule may be negated. FOIL has been applied \\nto a variety of problem domains. For example, it has been demonstrated to learn a \\nrecursive definition of the QUICKSORT algorithm and to learn to discriminate legal \\nfrom illegal chess positions. \\nThe FOIL algorithm is summarized in Table 10.4. Notice the outer loop \\ncorresponds to a variant of the SEQUENTIAL-COVERING algorithm discussed earlier; \\nthat is, it learns new rules one at a time, removing the positive examples covered by \\nthe latest rule before attempting to learn the next rule. The inner loop corresponds \\nto a variant of our earlier LEARN-ONE-RULE algorithm, extended to accommodate \\nfirst-order rules. Note also there are a few minor differences between FOIL and \\nthese earlier algorithms. In particular, FOIL seeks only rules that predict when \\nthe target literal is True, whereas our earlier algorithm would seek both rules \\nthat predict when it is True and rules that predict when it is False. Also, FOIL \\nperforms a simple hillclimbing search rather than a beam search (equivalently, it \\nuses a beam of width one). \\nThe hypothesis space search performed by FOIL is best understood by view- \\ning it hierarchically.

The \\nbinding {xlvictor, ylSharon} corresponds to a positive example binding, be- \\ncause the training data includes the assertion GrandDaughter(Victor, Sharon). \\nThe other 15 bindings allowed by the rule (e.g., the binding {x/Bob, y/Tom}) \\nconstitute negative evidence for the rule in the current example, because no cor- \\nresponding assertion can be found in the training data. \\nAt each stage, the rule is evaluated based on these sets of positive and neg- \\native variable bindings, with preference given to rules that possess more positive \\nbindings and fewer negative bindings. As new literals are added to the rule, the \\nsets of bindings will change. Note if a literal is added that introduces a new \\nvariable, then the bindings for the rule will grow in length (e.g., if Father(y, z) \\nis added to the above rule, then the original binding {xlvictor, y/Sharon) will \\nbecome the more lengthy {xlvictor, ylSharon, z/Bob}. Note also that if the new \\nvariable can bind to several different constants, then the number of bindings fitting \\nthe extended rule can be greater than the number associated with the original rule. \\nThe evaluation function used by FOIL to estimate the utility of adding a \\nnew literal is based on the numbers of positive and negative bindings covered \\nbefore and after adding the new literal. More precisely, consider some rule R, and \\na candidate literal L that might be added to the body of R. Let R' be the rule \\ncreated by adding literal L to rule R. The value Foil-Gain(L, R) of adding L to \\nR is defined as \\nP1 ) (10.1) Foil -Gain(L, R) = t - - log2 - \\nP1+ nl PO + no \\nwhere po is the number of positive bindings of rule R, no is the number of \\nnegative bindings of R, pl is the number of positive bindings of rule R', and \\nnl is the number of negative bindings of R'. Finally, t is the number of positive \\nbindings of rule R that are still covered after adding literal L to R. When a new \\nvariable is introduced into R by adding L, then any original binding is considered \\nto be covered so long as some binding extending it is present in the bindings \\nof R'.\"), Document(metadata={'producer': 'macOS Version 11.2.3 (Build 20D91) Quartz PDFContext', 'creator': 'Preview', 'creationdate': \"D:20210312135113Z00'00'\", 'title': 'Machine - Learning - Tom Mitchell.pdf', 'moddate': \"D:20210312135113Z00'00'\", 'source': '..\\\\Data\\\\PDFiles\\\\MachineLearningTomMitchell.pdf', 'total_pages': 421, 'page': 301, 'page_label': '302'}, page_content=\"This Foil-Gain function has a straightforward interpretation in terms of \\ninformation theory.

However, if we include the target predicate in the input list of \\nPredicates, then FOIL will consider it as well when generating candidate literals. \\nThis will allow it to form recursive rules-rules that use the same predicate in \\nthe body and the head of the rule. For instance, recall the following rule set that \\nprovides a recursive definition of the Ancestor relation. \\nIF Parent (x, y) THEN Ancestor(x, y) \\nIF Parent (x, z) A Ancestor(z, y) THEN Ancestor@, y) \\nGiven an appropriate set of training examples, these two rules can be learned \\nfollowing a trace similar to the one above for GrandDaughter.

Of course whether this particular \\nrule would be learned or not depends on whether these particular literals outscore \\ncompeting candidates during FOIL'S greedy search for increasingly specific rules. \\nCameron-Jones and Quinlan (1993) discuss several examples in which FOIL has \\nsuccessfully discovered recursive rule sets. They also discuss important subtleties \\nthat arise, such as how to avoid learning rule sets that produce infinite recursion. \\n10.5.4 Summary of FOIL \\nTo summarize, FOIL extends the sequential covering algorithm of CN2 to handle \\nthe case of learning first-order rules similar to Horn clauses. To learn each rule \\nFOIL performs a general-to-specific search, at each step adding a single new literal \\nto the rule preconditions. The new literal may refer to variables already mentioned \\nin the rule preconditions or postconditions, and may introduce new variables as \\nwell. At each step, it uses the Foil-Gain function of Equation (10.1) to select \\namong the candidate new literals. If new literals are allowed to refer to the target \\npredicate, then FOIL can, in principle, learn sets of recursive rules. While this in- \\ntroduces the complexity of avoiding rule sets that result in infinite recursion, FOIL \\nhas been demonstrated to successfully learn recursive rule sets in several cases.\"), Document(metadata={'producer': 'macOS Version 11.2.3 (Build 20D91) Quartz PDFContext', 'creator': 'Preview', 'creationdate': \"D:20210312135113Z00'00'\", 'title': 'Machine - Learning - Tom Mitchell.pdf', 'moddate': \"D:20210312135113Z00'00'\", 'source': '..\\\\Data\\\\PDFiles\\\\MachineLearningTomMitchell.pdf', 'total_pages': 421, 'page': 302, 'page_label': '303'}, page_content='In the case of noise-free training data, FOIL may continue adding new literals \\nto the rule until it covers no negative examples.

In general, \\nmachine learning involves building theories that explain the observed data. Given \\nsome data D and some partial background knowledge B, learning can be described \\nas generating a hypothesis h that, together with B, explains D. Put more precisely, \\nassume as usual that the training data D is a set of training examples, each of \\nthe form (xi, f (xi)). Here xi denotes the ith training instance and f (xi) denotes \\nits target value. Then learning is the problem of discovering a hypothesis h, such \\nthat the classification f (xi) of each training instance xi follows deductively from \\nthe hypothesis h, the description of xi, and any other background knowledge B \\nknown to the system. \\n(V(xi, f (xi)) E D) (B Ah A xi) f (xi) (10.2) \\nThe expression X F Y is read \"Y follows deductively from X,\" or alternatively \\n\"X entails Y.\" Expression (10.2) describes the constraint that must be satisfied \\nby the learned hypothesis h; namely, for every training instance xi, the target \\nclassification f (xi) must follow deductively from B, h, and xi. \\nAs an example, consider the case where the target concept to be learned is \\n\"pairs of people (u, v) such that the child of u is v,\" represented by the predicate \\nChild(u, v). Assume we are given a single positive example Child(Bob, Sharon), \\nwhere the instance is described by the literals Male(Bob), Female(Sharon), and \\nFather(Sharon, Bob). Furthermore, suppose we have the general background \\nknowledge Parent (u, v) t Father (u, v). We can describe this situation in the \\nterms of Equation (10.2) as follows: \\nxi : Male(Bob), Female(Sharon), Father(Sharon, Bob) \\nf (xi) : Child(Bob, Sharon) \\nIn this case, two of the many hypotheses that satisfy the constraint (B Ah A xi) t- \\nf (xi) are \\nhl : Child(u, v) t Father(v, u) \\nh2 : Child(u, v) t Parent (v, u)'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'macOS Version 11.2.3 (Build 20D91) Quartz PDFContext', 'creator': 'Preview', 'creationdate': \"D:20210312135113Z00'00'\", 'title': 'Machine - Learning - Tom Mitchell.pdf', 'moddate': \"D:20210312135113Z00'00'\", 'source': '..\\\\Data\\\\PDFiles\\\\MachineLearningTomMitchell.pdf', 'total_pages': 421, 'page': 303, 'page_label': '304'}, page_content='Note that the target literal Child(Bob, Sharon) is entailed by hl  AX^ with no need \\nfor the background information B. In the case of hypothesis h2, however, the \\nsituation is different. The target Child(Bob, Sharon) follows from B ~h2  AX^, but \\nnot from h2  AX^ alone. This example illustrates the role of background knowledge \\nin expanding the set of acceptable hypotheses for a given set of training data. It also \\nillustrates how new predicates (e.g., Parent) can be introduced into hypotheses \\n(e.g., h2), even when the predicate is not present in the original description of the \\ninstance xi. This process of augmenting the set of predicates, based on background \\nknowledge, is often referred to as constructive induction. \\nThe significance of Equation (10.2) is that it casts the learning problem in the \\nframework of deductive inference and formal logic. In the case of propositional \\nand first-order logics, there exist well-understood algorithms for automated deduc- \\ntion. Interestingly, it is possible to develop inverses of these procedures in order \\nto automate the process of inductive generalization. The insight that induction \\nmight be performed by inverting deduction appears to have been first observed \\nby the nineteenth century economist W. S. Jevons, who wrote: \\nInduction is, in fact, the inverse operation of deduction, and cannot be con- \\nceived to exist without the corresponding operation, so that the question of relative \\nimportance cannot arise.

(Jevons 1874) \\nIn the remainder of this chapter we will explore this view of induction \\nas the inverse of deduction. The general issue we will be interested in here is \\ndesigning inverse entailment operators. An inverse entailment operator, O(B, D) \\ntakes the training data D = {(xi, f (xi))} and background knowledge B as input \\nand produces as output a hypothesis h satisfying Equation (10.2). \\nO(B, D) = h such that (V(xi, f (xi)) E D) (B ~h A xi) F f (xi) \\nOf course there will, in general, be many different hypotheses h that satisfy \\n(V(X~, f (xi)) E D) (B A h A xi) F f (xi). One common heuristic in ILP for choos- \\ning among such hypotheses is to rely on the heuristic known as the Minimum \\nDescription Length principle (see Section 6.6). \\nThere are several attractive features to formulating the learning task as find- \\ning a hypothesis h that solves the relation (V(xi, f (xi)) E D) (B A h A xi) F f (xi). \\n0 This formulation subsumes the common definition of learning as finding \\nsome general concept that matches a given set of training examples (which \\ncorresponds to the special case where no background knowledge B is avail- \\nable). \\n0 By incorporating the notion of background information B, this formulation \\nallows a more rich definition of when a hypothesis may be said to \"fit\" \\nthe data.

The problem is that this expression does \\nnot allow for the possibility that there may be errors in the observed de- \\nscription of the instance xi or its target value f (xi). Such errors can produce \\nan inconsistent set of constraints on h. Unfortunately, most formal logic \\nframeworks completely lose their ability to distinguish between truth and \\nfalsehood once they are given inconsistent sets of assertions. \\n0 The language of first-order logic is so expressive, and the number of hy- \\npotheses that satisfy (V(xi , f (xi)) E D) (B A h A xi) t f (xi) is SO large, \\nthat the search through the space of hypotheses is intractable in the general \\ncase.

(However, see Chapters 11 and 12 for \\nalgorithms that use background knowledge to decrease rather than increase \\nsample complexity). \\nIn the following section, we examine one quite general inverse entailment \\noperator that constructs hypotheses by inverting a deductive inference rule. \\n10.7 INVERTING RESOLUTION \\nA general method for automated deduction is the resolution rule introduced by \\nRobinson (1965). The resolution rule is a sound and complete rule for deductive \\ninference in first-order logic. Therefore, it is sensible to ask whether we can invert \\nthe resolution rule to form an inverse entailment operator. The answer is yes, and \\nit is just this operator that forms the basis of the CIGOL program introduced by \\nMuggleton and Buntine (1988).'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'macOS Version 11.2.3 (Build 20D91) Quartz PDFContext', 'creator': 'Preview', 'creationdate': \"D:20210312135113Z00'00'\", 'title': 'Machine - Learning - Tom Mitchell.pdf', 'moddate': \"D:20210312135113Z00'00'\", 'source': '..\\\\Data\\\\PDFiles\\\\MachineLearningTomMitchell.pdf', 'total_pages': 421, 'page': 305, 'page_label': '306'}, page_content='It is easiest to introduce the resolution rule in propositional form, though it is \\nreadily extended to first-order representations. Let L be an arbitrary propositional \\nliteral, and let P and R be arbitrary propositional clauses. The resolution rule is \\nPVL \\n-L v R \\nPVR \\nwhich should be read as follows: Given the two clauses above the line, conclude \\nthe clause below the line. Intuitively, the resolution rule is quite sensible. Given \\nthe two assertions P v L and -L v R, it is obvious that either L or -L must be \\nfalse. Therefore, either P or R must be true. Thus, the conclusion P v R of the \\nresolution rule is intuitively satisfying. \\nThe general form of the propositional resolution operator is described in \\nTable 10.5. Given two clauses C1 and C2, the resolution operator first identifies \\na literal L that occurs as a positive literal in one of these two clauses and as \\na negative literal in the other. It then draws the conclusion given by the above \\nformula. For example, consider the application of the resolution operator illustrated \\non the left side of Figure 10.2. Given clauses C1 and C2, the first step of the \\nprocedure identifies the literal L = -KnowMaterial, which is present in C1, and \\nwhose negation -(-KnowMaterial) = KnowMaterial is present in C2. Thus the \\nconclusion is the clause formed by the union of the literals C1- (L} = Pass Exam \\nand C2 - (-L} = -Study. As another example, the result of applying the resolution \\nrule to the clauses C1 = A v B v C v -D and C2 = -B v E v F is the clause \\nAvCV-DvEvF. \\nIt is easy to invert the resolution operator to form an inverse entailment \\noperator O(C, C1) that performs inductive inference. In general, the inverse en- \\ntailment operator must derive one of the initial clauses, C2, given the resolvent C \\nand the other initial clause C1. Consider an example in which we are given the \\nresolvent C = A v B and the initial clause C1 = B v D. How can we derive a \\nclause C2 such that C1 A C2 F C?

In \\nparticular, C2 can also be the more specific clause A v -D v B. The difference \\nbetween this and our first solution is that we have now included in C2 a lit- \\neral that occurred in C1. The general point here is that inverse resolution is not \\ndeterministic-in general there may be multiple clauses C2 such that C1 and C2 \\nproduce the resolvent C.

However, CIGOL uses first-order \\nrather than propositional representations. Below we describe the extension of the \\nresolution rule required to accommodate first-order representations. \\n10.7.1 First-Order Resolution \\nThe resolution rule extends easily to first-order expressions. As in the propositional \\ncase, it takes two clauses as input and produces a third clause as output. The key \\ndifference from the propositional case is that the process is now based on the \\nnotion of unifying substitutions. \\nWe define a substitution to be any mapping of variables to terms. For ex- \\nample, the substitution 6 = {x/Bob, y/z} indicates that the variable x is to be \\nreplaced by the term Bob, and that the variable y is to be replaced by the term \\nz. We use the notation WO to denote the result of applying the substitution 6 to \\nsome expression W. For example, if L is the literal Father(x, Bill) and 6 is the \\nsubstitution defined above, then LO = Father(Bob, Bill). \\nWe say that 6 is a unifying substitution for two literals L1 and L2, provided \\nLlO = L2O. For example, if L1 = Father(x, y), L2 = Father(Bil1, z), and O = \\n(x/Bill, z/y}, then 6 is a unifying substitution for L1 and L2 because LlO = \\nL2O = Father(Bil1, y). The significance of a unifying substitution is this: In the \\npropositional form of resolution, the resolvent of two clauses C1 and C2 is found \\nby identifying a literal L that appears in C1 such that -L appears in C2. In first- \\norder resolution, this generalizes to finding one literal L1 from clause C1 and one \\nliteral L2 from C2, such that some unifying substitution 6 can be found for L1 \\nand -L2 (i.e., such that LIO = -L20). The resolution rule then constructs the \\nresolvent C according to the equation \\nThe general statement of the resolution rule is shown in Table 10.7. To \\nillustrate, suppose C1 = White(x) t Swan(x) and suppose C2 = Swan(Fred). \\nTo apply the resolution rule, we first re-express C1 in clause form as the equivalent \\nexpression C1 = White(x) v -Swan(x). The resolution rule can now be applied. \\nIn the first step, it finds the literal L1 = -Swan(x) from C1 and the literal L2 = \\nSwan(Fred) from C2. If we choose the unifying substitution O = {x/Fred} then \\nthese two literals satisfy LIB = -L20 = -Swan(Fred).

At each such \\nstep, note there are several possible outcomes, depending on the choices for the \\nsubstitutions. (See Exercise 10.7.) In the example of Figure 10.3, the particular set \\nof choices produces the intuitively satisfying final clause GrandChild(y, x) t \\nFather(x, 2) A Father(z, y). \\n10.7.3 Summary of Inverse Resolution \\nTo summarize, inverse resolution provides a general approach to automatically \\ngenerating hypotheses h that satisfy the constraint (B A h A xi) t- f (xi). This is \\naccomplished by inverting the general resolution rule given by Equation (10.3). \\nBeginning with the resolution rule and solving for the clause C2, the inverse \\nresolution rule of Equation (10.4) is easily derived. \\nGiven a set of beginning clauses, multiple hypotheses may be generated by \\nrepeated application of this inverse resolution rule. Note the inverse resolution rule \\nhas the advantage that it generates only hypotheses that satisfy (B ~h  AX^) t- f (xi).\"), Document(metadata={'producer': 'macOS Version 11.2.3 (Build 20D91) Quartz PDFContext', 'creator': 'Preview', 'creationdate': \"D:20210312135113Z00'00'\", 'title': 'Machine - Learning - Tom Mitchell.pdf', 'moddate': \"D:20210312135113Z00'00'\", 'source': '..\\\\Data\\\\PDFiles\\\\MachineLearningTomMitchell.pdf', 'total_pages': 421, 'page': 310, 'page_label': '311'}, page_content='In contrast, the generate-and-test search of FOIL generates many hypotheses at \\neach search step, including some that do not satisfy this constraint. FOIL then \\nconsiders the data D to choose among these hypotheses. Given this difference, \\nwe might expect the search based on inverse resolution to be more focused and \\nefficient. However, this will not necessarily be the case. One reason is that the \\ninverse resolution operator can consider only a small fraction of the available \\ndata when generating its hypothesis at any given step, whereas FOIL considers \\nall available data to select among its syntactically generated hypotheses. The \\ndifferences between search strategies that use inverse entailment and those that \\nuse generate-and-test search is a subject of ongoing research. Srinivasan et al. \\n(1995) provide one experimental comparison of these two approaches. \\n10.7.4 Generalization, 8-Subsumption, and Entailment \\nThe previous section pointed out the correspondence between induction and in- \\nverse entailment. Given our earlier focus on using the general-to-specific ordering \\nto organize the hypothesis search, it is interesting to consider the relationship be- \\ntween the more-general~han relation and inverse entailment. To illuminate this \\nrelationship, consider the following definitions. \\n0 more-general-than. In Chapter 2, we defined the more_general_than_or- \\nequal20 relation (z,) as follows: Given two boolean-valued functions hj(x) \\nand hk(x), we say that hj 2, hk if and only if (Vx)hk(x) + hj(x). This >, \\nrelation is used by many learning algorithms to guide search through the \\nhypothesis space. \\n0 8-subsumption. Consider two clauses Cj and Ck, both of the form H v L1 v \\n. . . L,, where H is a positive literal, and the Li are arbitrary literals. Clause \\nCj is said to 8-subsume clause Ck if and only if there exists a substitution \\n0 such that CjO G Ck (where we here describe any clause C by the set of \\nliterals in its disjunctive form). This definition is due to Plotkin (1970). \\n0 Entailment. Consider two clauses Cj and Ck. Clause Cj is said to entail \\nclause Ck (written Cj k Ck) if and only if Ck follows deductively from C,. \\nWhat is the relationship among these three definitions? First, let us re-express \\nthe definition of 2, using the same first-order notation as the other two definitions. \\nIf we consider a boolean-valued hypothesis h(x) for some target concept c(x), \\nwhere h(x) is expressed by a conjunction of literals, then we can re-express the \\nhypothesis as the clause \\nHere we follow the usual PROLOG interpretation that x is classified a negative \\nexample if it cannot be proven to be a positive example. Hence, we can see that \\nour earlier definition of 1, applies to the preconditions, or bodies, of Horn clauses. \\nThe implicit postcondition of the Horn clause is the target concept c(x).'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'macOS Version 11.2.3 (Build 20D91) Quartz PDFContext', 'creator': 'Preview', 'creationdate': \"D:20210312135113Z00'00'\", 'title': 'Machine - Learning - Tom Mitchell.pdf', 'moddate': \"D:20210312135113Z00'00'\", 'source': '..\\\\Data\\\\PDFiles\\\\MachineLearningTomMitchell.pdf', 'total_pages': 421, 'page': 311, 'page_label': '312'}, page_content='What is the relationship between this definition of 2, and the definition \\nof 8-subsumption? Note that if hl p, h2, then the clause C1 : c(x) t hl(x) \\n8-subsumes the clause C2 : c(x) t h2(x). Furthermore, 8-subsumption can hold \\neven when the clauses have different heads. For example, clause A 8-subsumes \\nclause B in the following case: \\nA : Mother(x, y) t Father(x, z) A Spouse(z, y) \\nB : Motker(x, Louise) t Father(x, Bob) A Spouse(Bob, y) A Female@) \\nbecause A8 G B if we choose 8 = {ylLouise, zlBob). The key difference here is \\nthat >, implicitly assumes two clauses for which the heads are the same, whereas \\n8-subsumption can hold even for clauses with different heads. \\nFinally, 8-subsumption is a special case of entailment. That is, if clause A \\n8-subsumes clause B, then A k B. However, we can find clauses A and B such \\nthat A F B, but where A does not 8-subsume B. One example is the following \\npair of clauses \\nA : Elephant(father_of (x)) t Elephant (x) \\nB : Elephant (f athersf (f ather-f (y))) t Elephant (y) \\nwhere f ather-of (x) is a function that refers to the individual who is the father \\nof x. Note that although B can be proven from A, there is no substitution 8 that \\nallows B to be &subsumed by A. \\nAs shown by these examples, our earlier notion of more-general~han is a \\nspecial case of 8-subsumption, which is itself a special case of entailment. There- \\nfore, searching the hypothesis space by generalizing or specializing hypotheses \\nis more limited than searching by using general inverse entailment operators. \\nUnfortunately, in its most general form, inverse entailment produces intractable \\nsearches. However, the intermediate notion of 8-subsumption provides one conve- \\nnient notion that lies midway between our earlier definition of more-general~han \\nand entailment. \\nAlthough inverse resolution is an intriguing method for generating candidate hy- \\npotheses, in practice it can easily lead to a combinatorial explosion of candidate \\nhypotheses. An alternative approach is to use inverse entailment to generate just \\nthe single most specific hypothesis that, together with the background informa- \\ntion, entails the observed data. This most specific hypothesis can then be used \\nto bound a general-to-specific search through the hypothesis space similar to that \\nused by FOIL, but with the additional constraint that the only hypotheses consid- \\nered are hypotheses more general than this bound. This approach is employed by \\nthe PROGOL system, whose algorithm can be summarized as follows: \\n1.

PROGOL uses a sequential covering algorithm to learn a set of expressions \\nfrom H that cover the data. For each example (xi, f (xi)) that is not yet \\ncovered by these learned expressions, it first searches for the most specific \\nhypothesis hi within H such that (B A hi A xi) l- f (xi). More precisely, it \\napproximates this by calculating the most specific hypothesis among those \\nthat entail f (xi) within k applications of the resolution rule (where k is a \\nuser-specified parameter). \\n3. PROGOL then performs a general-to-specific search of the hypothesis space \\nbounded by the most general possible hypothesis and by the specific bound \\nhi calculated in step 2. Within this set of hypotheses, it seeks the hypothesis \\nhaving minimum description length (measured by the number of literals). \\nThis part of the search is guided by an A*-like heuristic that allows pruning \\nwithout running the risk of pruning away the shortest hypothesis. \\nThe details of the PROGOL algorithm are described by Muggleton (1992, \\n1995). \\n10.8 SUMMARY AND FURTHER READING \\nThe main points of this chapter include: \\nThe sequential covering algorithm learns a disjunctive set of rules by first \\nlearning a single accurate rule, then removing the positive examples covered \\nby this rule and iterating the process over the remaining training examples. \\nIt provides an efficient, greedy algorithm for learning rule sets, and an al- \\nternative to top-down decision tree learning algorithms such as ID3, which \\ncan be viewed as simultaneous, rather than sequential covering algorithms. \\n0 In the context of sequential covering algorithms, a variety of methods have \\nbeen explored for learning a single rule. These methods vary in the search \\nstrategy they use for examining the space of possible rule preconditions. One \\npopular approach, exemplified by the CN2 program, is to conduct a general- \\nto-specific beam search, generating and testing progressively more specific \\nrules until a sufficiently accurate rule is found. Alternative approaches search \\nfrom specific to general hypotheses, use an example-driven search rather than \\ngenerate and test, and employ different statistical measures of rule accuracy \\nto guide the search. \\nSets of first-order rules (i.e., rules containing variables) provide a highly \\nexpressive representation. For example, the programming language PROLOG \\nrepresents general programs using collections of first-order Horn clauses. \\nThe problem of learning first-order Horn clauses is therefore often referred \\nto as the problem of inductive logic programming. \\nOne approach to learning sets of first-order rules is to extend the sequential \\ncovering algorithm of CN2 from propositional to first-order representations.'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'macOS Version 11.2.3 (Build 20D91) Quartz PDFContext', 'creator': 'Preview', 'creationdate': \"D:20210312135113Z00'00'\", 'title': 'Machine - Learning - Tom Mitchell.pdf', 'moddate': \"D:20210312135113Z00'00'\", 'source': '..\\\\Data\\\\PDFiles\\\\MachineLearningTomMitchell.pdf', 'total_pages': 421, 'page': 313, 'page_label': '314'}, page_content='This approach is exemplified by the FOIL program, which can learn sets of \\nfirst-order rules, including simple recursive rule sets. \\n0 A second approach to learning first-order rules is based on the observation \\nthat induction is the inverse of deduction.

For example, CIGOL uses inverse resolution, an \\noperation that is the inverse of the deductive resolution operator commonly \\nused for mechanical theorem proving. PROGOL combines an inverse entail- \\nment strategy with a general-to-specific strategy for searching the hypothesis \\nspace. \\nEarly work on learning relational descriptions includes Winston\\'s (1970) \\nwell-known program for learning network-style descriptions for concepts such \\nas \"arch.\" Banerji7s (1964, 1969) work and Michalski7s series of AQ programs \\n(e.g., Michalski 1969; Michalski et al. 1986) were among the earliest to ex- \\nplore the use of logical representations in learning. Plotkin\\'s (1970) definition of \\n8-subsumption provided an early formalization of the relationship between induc- \\ntion and deduction. Vere (1975) also explored learning logical representations, \\nand Buchanan\\'s (1976) META-DENDRAL program learned relational descriptions \\nrepresenting molecular substructures likely to fragment in a mass spectrometer. \\nThis program succeeded in discovering useful rules that were subsequently pub- \\nlished in the chemistry literature. Mitchell\\'s (1979) CANDIDATE-ELIMINATION ver- \\nsion space algorithm was applied to these same relational descriptions of chemical \\nstructures. \\nWith the popularity of the PROLOG language in the mid-1980~~ researchers \\nbegan to look more carefully at learning relational descriptions represented by \\nHorn clauses.

The FOCL algorithm is described in \\nChapter 12. \\nAn alternative line of research on learning Horn clauses by inverse entail- \\nment was spurred by Muggleton and Buntine (1988), who built on related ideas \\nby Sammut and Banerji (1986) and Muggleton (1987).

Consider a sequential covering algorithm such as CN2 and a simultaneous covering \\nalgorithm such as ID3. Both algorithms are to be used to learn a target concept \\ndefined over instances represented by conjunctions of n boolean attributes.

How many rules will be formed if this tree is re-expressed as \\nt a disjunctive set of rules? How many preconditions will each ru?e possess? How \\nmany distinct choices would a sequential covering algorithm have to make to learn \\nthis same set of rules? Which system do you suspect would be more prone to \\noverfitting if both were given the same training data? \\n10.2.

Analytical learning uses prior knowledge and deductive reasoning to \\naugment the information provided by the training examples, so that it is not subject \\nto these same bounds. This chapter considers an analytical learning method called \\nexplanation-based learning (EBL). In explanation-based learning, prior knowledge \\nis used to analyze, or explain, how each observed training example satisfies the \\ntarget concept. This explanation is then used to distinguish the relevant features \\nof the training example from the irrelevant, so that examples can be generalized \\nbased on logical rather than statistical reasoning. Explanation-based learning has \\nbeen successfully applied to learning search control rules for a variety of planning \\nand scheduling tasks. This chapter considers explanation-based learning when the \\nlearner's prior knowledge is correct and complete. The next chapter considers com- \\nbining inductive and analytical learning in situations where prior knowledge is only \\napproximately correct. \\n11.1 INTRODUCTION \\nPrevious chapters have considered a variety of inductive learning methods: that is, \\nmethods that generalize from observed training examples by identifying features \\nthat empirically distinguish positive from negative training examples.

The \\nkey practical limit on these inductive learners is that they perform poorly when \\ninsufficient data is available. In fact, as discussed in Chapter 7, theoretical analysis \\nshows that there are fundamental bounds on the accuracy that can be achieved \\nwhen learning inductively from a given number of training examples. \\nCan we develop learning methods that are not subject to these fundamental \\nbounds on learning accuracy imposed by the amount of training data available? \\nYes, if we are willing to reconsider the formulation of the learning problem itself. \\nOne way is to develop learning algorithms that accept explicit prior knowledge as \\nan input, in addition to the input training data. Explanation-based learning is one \\nsuch approach. It uses prior knowledge to analyze, or explain, each training exam- \\nple in order to infer which example features are relevant to the target function and \\nwhich are irrelevant. These explanations enable it to generalize more accurately \\nthan inductive systems that rely on the data alone. As we saw in the previous chap- \\nter, inductive logic programming systems such as CIGOL also use prior background \\nknowledge to guide learning. However, they use their background knowledge to \\ninfer features that augment the input descriptions of instances, thereby increasing \\nthe complexity of the hypothesis space to be searched. In contrast, explanation- \\nbased learning uses prior knowledge to reduce the complexity of the hypothesis \\nspace to be searched, thereby reducing sample complexity and improving gener- \\nalization accuracy of the learner. \\nTo capture the intuition underlying explanation-based learning, consider the \\ntask of learning to play chess. In particular, suppose we would like our chess \\nprogram to learn to recognize important classes of game positions, such as the \\ntarget concept \"chessboard positions in which black will lose its queen within \\ntwo moves.\" Figure 11.1 shows a positive training example of this target concept. \\nInductive learning methods could, of course, be employed to learn this target \\nconcept. However, because the chessboard is fairly complex (there are 32 pieces \\nthat may be on any of 64 squares), and because the particular patterns that capture \\nthis concept are fairly subtle (involving the relative positions of various pieces on \\nthe board), we would have to provide thousands of training examples similar to \\nthe one in Figure 1 1.1 to expect an inductively learned hypothesis to generalize \\ncorrectly to new situations. \\nFIGURE 11.1 \\nA positive example of the target concept \"chess positions in \\nwhich black will lose its queen within two moves.\" Note the \\nwhite knight is simultaneously attacking both the black king and \\nqueen.

In fact, after \\nconsidering only the single example shown in Figure 1 1.1, most people would \\nbe willing to suggest a general hypothesis for the target concept, such as \"board \\npositions in which the black king and queen are simultaneously attacked,\" and \\nwould not even consider the (equally consistent) hypothesis \"board positions in \\nwhich four white pawns are still in their original locations.\" How is it that humans \\ncan generalize so successfully from just this one example? \\nThe answer appears to be that people rely heavily on explaining, or analyz- \\ning, the training example in terms of their prior knowledge about the legal moves \\nof chess. If asked to explain why the training example of Figure 11.1 is a positive \\nexample of \"positions in which the queen will be lost in two moves,\" most people \\nwould give an explanation similar to the following: \"Because white\\'s knight is \\nattacking both the king and queen, black must move out of check, thereby al- \\nlowing the knight to capture the queen.\" The importance of such explanations is \\nthat they provide the information needed to rationally generalize from the details \\nof the training example to a correct general hypothesis. Features of the training \\nexample that are mentioned by the explanation (e.g., the position of the white \\nknight, black king, and black queen) are relevant to the target concept and should \\nbe included in the general hypothesis. In contrast, features of the example that are \\nnot mentioned by the explanation (e.g., the fact that there are six black pawns on \\nthe board) can be assumed to be irrelevant details. \\nWhat exactly is the prior knowledge needed by a learner to construct the \\nexplanation in this chess example? It is simply knowledge about the legal rules of \\nchess: knowledge of which moves are legal for the knight and other pieces, the fact \\nthat players must alternate moves in the game, and the fact that to win the game one \\nplayer must capture his opponent\\'s king. Note that given just this prior knowledge \\nit is possible in principle to calculate the optimal chess move for any board \\nposition. However, in practice this calculation can be frustratingly complex and \\ndespite the fact that we humans ourselves possess this complete, perfect knowledge \\nof chess, we remain unable to play the game optimally. As a result, much of human \\nlearning in chess (and in other search-intensive problems such as scheduling and \\nplanning) involves a long process of uncovering the consequences of our prior \\nknowledge, guided by specific training examples encountered as we play the game. \\nThis chapter describes learning algorithms that automatically construct and \\nlearn from such explanations. In the remainder of this section we define more \\nprecisely the analytical learning problem. The next section presents a particular \\nexplanation-based learning algorithm called PROLOG-EBG. Subsequent sections \\nthen examine the general properties of this algorithm and its relationship to in- \\nductive learning algorithms discussed in other chapters. The final section describes \\nthe application of explanation-based learning to improving performance at large \\nstate-space search problems.

(x,, f (x,))} where f (xi) is the target value for the instance \\nxi. The desired output of the learner is a hypothesis h from H that is con- \\nsistent with these training examples. \\n0 In analytical learning, the input to the learner includes the same hypothesis \\nspace H and training examples D as for inductive learning. In addition, \\nthe learner is provided an additional input: A domain theory B consisting \\nof background knowledge that can be used to explain observed training \\nexamples. The desired output of ,the learner is a hypothesis h from H that \\nis consistent with both the training examples D and the domain theory B. \\nTo illustrate, in our chess example each instance xi would describe a particular \\nchess position, and f (xi) would be True when xi is a position for which black \\nwill lose its queen within two moves, and False otherwise. We might define \\nthe hypothesis space H to consist of sets of Horn clauses (if-then rules) as in \\nChapter 10, where the predicates used by the rules refer to the positions or relative \\npositions of specific pieces on the board. The domain theory B would consist of a \\nformalization of the rules of chess, describing the legal moves, the fact that players \\nmust take turns, and the fact that the game is won when one player captures her \\nopponent\\'s king. \\nNote in analytical learning, the learner must output a hypothesis that is con- \\nsistent with both the training data and the domain theory. We say that hypothesis \\nh is consistent with domain theory B provided B does not entail the negation of \\nh (i.e., B -h). This additional constraint that the output hypothesis must be \\nconsistent with B reduces the ambiguity faced by the learner when the data alone \\ncannot resolve among all hypotheses in H. The net effect, provided the domain \\ntheory is correct, is to increase the accuracy of the output hypothesis. \\nLet us introduce in detail a second example of an analytical learning prob- \\nlem--one that we will use for illustration throughout this chapter. Consider an \\ninstance space X in which each instance is a pair of physical objects. Each of the \\ntwo physical objects in the instance is described by the predicates Color, Volume, \\nOwner, Material, Type, and Density, and the relationship between the two objects \\nis described by the predicate On. Given this instance space, the task is to learn the \\ntarget concept \"pairs of physical objects, such that one can be stacked safely on \\nthe other,\" denoted by the predicate SafeToStack(x,y).

Finally, notice \\nthat the domain theory shown in the table is sufficient to prove that the positive \\nexample shown there satisfies the target concept SafeToStack. \\n11.2 LEARNING WITH PERFECT DOMAIN THEORIES: \\nPROLOG-EBG \\nAs stated earlier, in this chapter we consider explanation-based learning from \\ndomain theories that are perfect, that is, domain theories that are correct and \\ncomplete. A domain theory is said to be correct if each of its assertions is a \\ntruthful statement about the world. A domain theory is said to be complete with \\nrespect to a given target concept and instance space, if the domain theory covers \\nevery positive example in the instance space. Put another way, it is complete if \\nevery instance that satisfies the target concept can be proven by the domain theory \\nto satisfy it. Notice our definition of completeness does not require that the domain \\ntheory be able to prove that negative examples do not satisfy the target concept. \\nHowever, if we follow the usual PROLOG convention that unprovable assertions are \\nassumed to be false, then this definition of completeness includes full coverage \\nof both positive and negative examples by the domain theory. \\nThe reader may well ask at this point whether it is reasonable to assume that \\nsuch perfect domain theories are available to the learner. After all, if the learner \\nhad a perfect domain theory, why would it need to learn? There are two responses \\nto this question. \\nFirst, there are cases in which it is feasible to provide a perfect domain \\ntheory. Our earlier chess problem provides one such case, in which the legal \\nmoves of chess form a perfect domain theory from which the optimal chess \\nplaying strategy can (in principle) be inferred. Furthermore, although it is \\nquite easy to write down the legal moves of chess that constitute this domain \\ntheory, it is extremely difficult to write down the optimal chess-playing \\nstrategy. In such cases, we prefer to provide the domain theory to the learner \\nand rely on the learner to formulate a useful description of the target concept \\n(e.g., \"board states in which I am about to lose my queen\") by examining \\nand generalizing from specific training examples. Section 11.4 describes the \\nsuccessful application of explanation-based learning with perfect domain'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'macOS Version 11.2.3 (Build 20D91) Quartz PDFContext', 'creator': 'Preview', 'creationdate': \"D:20210312135113Z00'00'\", 'title': 'Machine - Learning - Tom Mitchell.pdf', 'moddate': \"D:20210312135113Z00'00'\", 'source': '..\\\\Data\\\\PDFiles\\\\MachineLearningTomMitchell.pdf', 'total_pages': 421, 'page': 324, 'page_label': '325'}, page_content='theories to automatically improve performance at several search-intensive \\nplanning and optimization problems. \\n0 Second, in many other cases it is unreasonable to assume that a perfect \\ndomain theory is available. It is difficult to write a perfectly correct and \\ncomplete theory even for our relatively simple SafeToStack problem. A more \\nrealistic assumption is that plausible explanations based on imperfect domain \\ntheories must be used, rather than exact proofs based on perfect knowledge. \\nNevertheless, we can begin to understand the role of explanations in learning \\nby considering the ideal case of perfect domain theories. In Chapter 12 we \\nwill consider learning from imperfect domain theories. \\nThis section presents an algorithm called PROLOG-EBG (Kedar-Cabelli and \\nMcCarty 1987) that is representative of several explanation-based learning algo- \\nrithms. PROLOG-EBG is a sequential covering algorithm (see Chapter 10). In other \\nwords, it operates by learning a single Horn clause rule, removing the positive \\ntraining examples covered by this rule, then iterating this process on the remain- \\ning positive examples until no further positive examples remain uncovered. When \\ngiven a complete and correct domain theory, PROLOG-EBG is guaranteed to output \\na hypothesis (set of rules) that is itself correct and that covers the observed pos- \\nitive training examples. For any set of training examples, the hypothesis output \\nby PROLOG-EBG constitutes a set of logically sufficient conditions for the target \\nconcept, according to the domain theory. PROLOG-EBG is a refinement of the EBG \\nalgorithm introduced by Mitchell et al. (1986) and is similar to the EGGS algo- \\nrithm described by DeJong and Mooney (1986). The PROLOG-EBG algorithm is \\nsummarized in Table 1 1.2. \\n11.2.1 An Illustrative Trace \\nTo illustrate, consider again the training example and domain theory shown in \\nTable 1 1.1. As summarized in Table 1 1.2, the PROLOG-EBG algorithm is a se- \\nquential covering algorithm that considers the training data incrementally. For \\neach new positive training example that is not yet covered by a learned Horn \\nclause, it forms a new Horn clause by: (1) explaining the new positive training \\nexample, (2) analyzing this explanation to determine an appropriate generaliza- \\ntion, and (3) refining the current hypothesis by adding a new Horn clause rule to \\ncover this positive example, as well as other similar instances. Below we examine \\neach of these three steps in turn. \\n11.2.1.1 EXPLAIN THE TRAINING EXAMPLE \\nThe first step in processing each novel training example is to construct an expla- \\nnation in terms of the domain theory, showing how this positive example satisfies \\nthe target concept.

The top of the figure depicts \\nthe explanation constructed for this training example. Notice the explanation, or \\nproof, states that it is SafeToStack Objl on 0bj2 because Objl is Lighter than \\nObj2. Furthermore, Objl is known to be Lighter, because its Weight can be \\ninferred from its Density and Volume, and because the Weight of 0bj2 can be \\ninferred from the default weight of an Endtable. The specific Horn clauses that \\nunderlie this explanation are shown in the domain theory of Table 1 1.1. Notice that \\nthe explanation mentions only a small fraction of the known attributes of Objl \\nand 0bj2 (i.e., those attributes corresponding to the shaded region in the figure). \\nWhile only a single explanation is possible for the training example and \\ndomain theory shown here, in general there may be multiple possible explanations. \\nIn such cases, any or all of the explanations may be used.

PROLOG- \\nEBG computes the most general rule that can be justified by the explanation, by \\ncomputing the weakest preimage of the explanation, defined as follows: \\nDefinition: The weakest preimage of a conclusion C with respect to a proof P is \\nthe most general set of initial assertions A, such that A entails C according to P. \\nFor example, the weakest preimage of the target concept SafeToStack(x,y), \\nwith respect to the explanation from Table 11.1, is given by the body of the \\nfollowing rule.

The regression procedure operates on a domain theory represented by an \\narbitrary set of Horn clauses. It works iteratively backward through the explana- \\ntion, first computing the weakest preimage of the target concept with respect to \\nthe final proof step in the explanation, then computing the weakest preimage of \\nthe resulting expressions with respect to the preceding step, and so on. The pro- \\ncedure terminates when it has iterated over all steps :in the explanation, yielding \\nthe weakest precondition of the target concept with respect to the literals at the \\nleaf nodes of the explanation. \\nA trace of this regression process is illustrated in Figure 11.3. In this fig- \\nure, the explanation from Figure 11.2 is redrawn in standard (nonitalic) font. The \\nfrontier of regressed expressions created at each step by the regression proce- \\ndure is shown underlined in italics. The process begins at the root of the tree, \\nwith the frontier initialized to the general target concept SafeToStack(x,y). The \\nfirst step is to compute the weakest preimage of this frontier expression with \\nrespect to the final (top-most) inference rule in the explanation.

The following are the key properties \\nof this algorithm. \\n0 Unlike inductive methods, PROLOG-EBG produces justified general hypothe- \\nses by using prior knowledge to analyze individual examples. \\n0 The explanation of how the example satisfies the target concept determines \\nwhich example attributes are relevant: those mentioned by the explanation. \\n0 The further analysis of the explanation, regressing the target concept to de- \\ntermine its weakest preimage with respect to the explanation, allows deriving \\nmore general constraints on the values of the relevant features. \\n0 Each learned Horn clause corresponds to a sufficient condition for satisfy- \\ning the target concept. The set of learned Horn clauses covers the positive \\ntraining examples encountered by the learner, as well as other instances that \\nshare the same explanations. \\n0 The generality of the learned Horn clauses will depend on the formulation \\nof the domain theory and on the sequence in which training examples are \\nconsidered. \\n0 PROLOG-EBG implicitly assumes that the domain theory is correct and com- \\nplete. If the domain theory is incorrect or incomplete, the resulting learned \\nconcept may also be incorrect. \\nThere are several related perspectives on explanation-based learning that \\nhelp to understand its capabilities and limitations. \\n0 EBL as theory-guided generalization of examples. EBL uses its given domain \\ntheory to generalize rationally from examples, distinguishing the relevant ex- \\nample attributes from the irrelevant, thereby allowing it to avoid the bounds \\non sample complexity that apply to purely inductive learning. This is the \\nperspective implicit in the above description of the PROLOG-EBG algorithm. \\n0 EBL as example-guided reformulation of theories. The PROLOG-EBG algo- \\nrithm can be viewed as a method for reformulating the domain theory into a \\nmore operational form. In particular, the original domain theory is reformu- \\nlated by creating rules that (a) follow deductively from the domain theory,\"), Document(metadata={'producer': 'macOS Version 11.2.3 (Build 20D91) Quartz PDFContext', 'creator': 'Preview', 'creationdate': \"D:20210312135113Z00'00'\", 'title': 'Machine - Learning - Tom Mitchell.pdf', 'moddate': \"D:20210312135113Z00'00'\", 'source': '..\\\\Data\\\\PDFiles\\\\MachineLearningTomMitchell.pdf', 'total_pages': 421, 'page': 331, 'page_label': '332'}, page_content='and (b) classify the observed training examples in a single inference step. \\nThus, the learned rules can be seen as a reformulation of the domain theory \\ninto a set of special-case rules capable of classifying instances of the target \\nconcept in a single inference step. \\n0 EBL as \"just\" restating what the learner already \"knows. \" In one sense, the \\nlearner in our SafeToStack example begins with full knowledge of the Safe- \\nToStack concept. That is, if its initial domain theory is sufficient to explain \\nany observed training examples, then it is also sufficient to predict their \\nclassification in advance. In what sense, then, does this qualify as learning? \\nOne answer is that in many tasks the difference between what one knows \\nin principle and what one can efficiently compute in practice may be great, \\nand in such cases this kind of \"knowledge reformulation\" can be an impor- \\ntant form of learning. In playing chess, for example, the rules of the game \\nconstitute a perfect domain theory, sufficient in principle to play perfect \\nchess. Despite this fact, people still require considerable experience to learn \\nhow to play chess well. This is precisely a situation in which a complete, \\nperfect domain theory is already known to the (human) learner, and further \\nlearning is \"simply\" a matter of reformulating this knowledge into a form \\nin which it can be used more effectively to select appropriate moves. A be- \\nginning course in Newtonian physics exhibits the same property-the basic \\nlaws of physics are easily stated, but students nevertheless spend a large \\npart of a semester working out the consequences so they have this knowl- \\nedge in more operational form and need not derive every problem solution \\nfrom first principles come the final exam. PROLOG-EBG performs this type \\nof reformulation of knowledge-its learned rules map directly from observ- \\nable instance features to the classification relative to the target concept, in a \\nway that is consistent with the underlying domain theory. Whereas it may \\nrequire many inference steps and considerable search to classify an arbi- \\ntrary instance using the original domain theory, the learned rules classify \\nthe observed instances in a single inference step. \\nThus, in its pure form EBL involves reformulating the domain theory to \\nproduce general rules that classify examples in a single inference step. This kind \\nof knowledge reformulation is sometimes referred to as knowledge compilation, \\nindicating that the transformation is an efficiency improving one that does not \\nalter the correctness of the system\\'s knowledge. \\n11.3.1 Discovering New Features \\nOne interesting capability of PROLOG-EBG is its ability to formulate new features \\nthat are not explicit in the description of the training examples, but that are needed \\nto describe the general rule underlying the training example. This capability is \\nillustrated by the algorithm trace and the learned rule in the previous section. In \\nparticular, the learned rule asserts that the essential constraint on the Volume and \\nDensity of x is that their product is less than 5.

Instead, \\nthis constraint is formulated automatically by the learner. \\nNotice this learned \"feature\" is similar in kind to the types of features repre- \\nsented by the hidden units of neural networks; that is, this feature is one of a very \\nlarge set of potential features that can be computed from the available instance \\nattributes. Like the BACKPROPAGATION algorithm, PROLOG-EBG automatically for- \\nmulates such features in its attempt to fit the training data. However, unlike the \\nstatistical process that derives hidden unit features in neural networks from many \\ntraining examples, PROLOG-EBG employs an analytical process to derive new fea- \\ntures based on analysis of single training examples. Above, PROLOG-EBG derives \\nthe feature Volume . Density > 5 analytically from the particular instantiation \\nof the domain theory used to explain a single training example. For example, \\nthe notion that the product of Volume and Density is important arises from the \\ndomain theory rule that defines Weight. The notion that this product should be \\nless than 5 arises from two other domain theory rules that assert that Obj 1 should \\nbe Lighter than the Endtable, and that the Weight of the Endtable is 5. Thus, \\nit is the particular composition and instantiation of these primitive terms from the \\ndomain theory that gives rise to defining this new feature. \\nThe issue of automatically learning useful features to augment the instance \\nrepresentation is an important issue for machine learning. The analytical derivation \\nof new features in explanation-based learning and the inductive derivation of new \\nfeatures in the hidden layer of neural networks provide two distinct approaches. \\nBecause they rely on different sources of information (statistical regularities over \\nmany examples versus analysis of single examples using the domain theory), it \\nmay be useful to explore new methods that combine both sources. \\n11.3.2 Deductive Learning \\nIn its pure form, PROLOG-EBG is a deductive, rather than inductive, learning pro- \\ncess. That is, by calculating the weakest preimage of the explanation it produces \\na hypothesis h that follows deductively from the domain theory B, while covering \\nthe training data D. To be more precise, PROLOG-EBG outputs a hypothesis h that \\nsatisfies the following two constraints: \\nwhere the training data D consists of a set of training examples in which xi is the \\nith training instance and f (xi) is its target value (f is the target function). Notice \\nthe first of these constraints is simply a formalization of the usual requirement in \\nmachine learning, that the hypothesis h correctly predict the target value f (xi) for \\neach instance xi in the training data.t Of course there will, in general, be many \\nt~ere we include PROLOG-S~Y~ negation-by-failure in our definition of entailment (F), so that ex- \\namples are entailed to be negative examples if they cannot be proven to be positive.'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'macOS Version 11.2.3 (Build 20D91) Quartz PDFContext', 'creator': 'Preview', 'creationdate': \"D:20210312135113Z00'00'\", 'title': 'Machine - Learning - Tom Mitchell.pdf', 'moddate': \"D:20210312135113Z00'00'\", 'source': '..\\\\Data\\\\PDFiles\\\\MachineLearningTomMitchell.pdf', 'total_pages': 421, 'page': 333, 'page_label': '334'}, page_content=\"alternative hypotheses that satisfy this first constraint. The second constraint de- \\nscribes the impact of the domain theory in PROLOG-EBL: The output hypothesis is \\nfurther constrained so that it must follow from the domain theory and the data. This \\nsecond constraint reduces the ambiguity faced by the learner when it must choose \\na hypothesis. Thus, the impact of the domain theory is to reduce the effective size \\nof the hypothesis space and hence reduce the sample complexity of learning. \\nUsing similar notation, we can state the type of knowledge that is required \\nby PROLOG-EBG for its domain theory. In particular, PROLOG-EBG assumes the \\ndomain theory B entails the classifications of the instances in the training data: \\nThis constraint on the domain theory B assures that an explanation can be con- \\nstructed for each positive example. \\nIt is interesting to compare the PROLOG-EBG learning setting to the setting \\nfor inductive logic programming (ILP) discussed in Chapter 10. In that chapter, \\nwe discussed a generalization of the usual inductive learning task, in which back- \\nground knowledge B' is provided to the learner. We will use B' rather than B to \\ndenote the background knowledge used by ILP, because it does not typically sat- \\nisfy the constraint given by Equation (1 1.3). ILP is an inductive learning system, \\nwhereas PROLOG-EBG is deductive. ILP uses its background knowledge B' to en- \\nlarge the set of hypotheses to be considered, whereas PROLOG-EBG uses its domain \\ntheory B to reduce the set of acceptable hypotheses. As stated in Equation (10.2), \\nILP systems output a hypothesis h that satisfies the following constraint: \\nNote the relationship between this expression and the constraints on h imposed \\nby PROLOG-EBG (given by Equations (1 1.1) and (1 1.2)). This ILP constraint on \\nh is a weakened form of the constraint given by Equation (1 1.1)-the ILP con- \\nstraint requires only that (B' A h /\\\\xi) k f (xi), whereas the PROLOG-EBG constraint \\nrequires the more strict (h  xi) k f (xi). Note also that ILP imposes no constraint \\ncorresponding to the PROLOG-EBG constraint of Equation (1 1.2). \\n11.3.3 Inductive Bias in Explanation-Based Learning \\nRecall from Chapter 2 that the inductive bias of a learning algorithm is a set \\nof assertions that, together with the training examples, deductively entail sub- \\nsequent predictions made by the learner. The importance of inductive bias is \\nthat it characterizes how the learner generalizes beyond the observed training \\nexamples. \\nWhat is the inductive bias of PROLOG-EBG? In PROLOG-EBG the output hy- \\npothesis h follows deductively from DAB, as described by Equation (1 1.2). There- \\nfore, the domain theory B is a set of assertions which, together with the training \\nexamples, entail the output hypothesis. Given that predictions of the learner follow \\nfrom this hypothesis h, it appears that the inductive bias of PROLOG-EBG is simply \\nthe domain theory B input to the learner.

The remaining component of the inductive \\nbias is therefore the basis by which PROLOG-EBG chooses among these alternative \\nsets of Horn clauses. As we saw above, PROLOG-EBG employs a sequential cover- \\ning algorithm that continues to formulate additional Horn clauses until all positive \\ntraining examples have been covered. Furthermore, each individual Horn clause \\nis the most general clause (weakest preimage) licensed by the explanation of the \\ncurrent training example. Therefore, among the sets of Horn clauses entailed by \\nthe domain theory, we can characterize the bias of PROLOG-EBG as a preference \\nfor small sets of maximally general Horn clauses. In fact, the greedy algorithm of \\nPROLOG-EBG is only a heuristic approximation to the exhaustive search algorithm \\nthat would be required to find the truly shortest set of maximally general Horn \\nclauses. Nevertheless, the inductive bias of PROLOG-EBG can be approximately \\ncharacterized in this fashion. \\nApproximate inductive bias of PROLOG-EBG: The domain theory B, plus a pref- \\nerence for small sets of maximally general Horn clauses. \\nThe most important point here is that the inductive bias of PROLOG-EBG- \\nthe policy by which it generalizes beyond the training data-is largely determined \\nby the input domain theory. This lies in stark contrast to most of the other learning \\nalgorithms we have discussed (e.g., neural networks, decision tree learning), in \\nwhich the inductive bias is a fixed property of the learning algorithm, typically \\ndetermined by the syntax of its hypothesis representation. Why is it important \\nthat the inductive bias be an input parameter rather than a fixed property of the \\nlearner? Because, as we have discussed in Chapter 2 and elsewhere, there is \\nno universally effective inductive bias and because bias-free learning is futile. \\nTherefore, any attempt to develop a general-purpose learning method must at \\nminimum allow the inductive bias to vary with the learning problem at hand. \\nOn a more practical level, in many tasks it is quite natural to input domain- \\nspecific knowledge (e.g., the knowledge about Weight in the SafeToStack ex- \\nample) to influence how the learner will generalize beyond the training data. \\nIn contrast, it is less natural to \"implement\" an appropriate bias by restricting \\nthe syntactic form of the hypotheses (e.g., prefer short decision trees). Finally, \\nif we consider the larger issue of how an autonomous agent may improve its \\nlearning capabilities over time, then it is attractive to have a learning algorithm \\nwhose generalization capabilities improve as it acquires more knowledge of its \\ndomain. \\n11.3.4 Knowledge Level Learning \\nAs pointed out in Equation (1 1.2), the hypothesis h output by PROLOG-EBG follows \\ndeductively from the domain theory B and training data D.

The LEMMA-ENUMERATOR algorithm simply enumerates \\nall proof trees that conclude the target concept based on assertions in the domain \\ntheory B. For each such proof tree, LEMMA-ENUMERATOR calculates the weakest \\npreimage and constructs a Horn clause, in the same fashion as PROLOG-EBG. The \\nonly difference between LEMMA-ENUMERATOR and PROLOG-EBG is that LEMMA- \\nENUMERATOR ignores the training data and enumerates all proof trees. \\nNotice LEMMA-ENUMERATOR will output a superset of the Horn clauses output \\nby PROLOG-EBG. Given this fact, several questions arise. First, if its hypotheses \\nfollow from the domain theory alone, then what is the role of training data in \\nPROLOG-EBG? The answer is that training examples focus the PROLOG-EBG al- \\ngorithm on generating rules that cover the distribution of instances that occur in \\npractice. In our original chess example, for instance, the set of all possible lemmas \\nis huge, whereas the set of chess positions that occur in normal play is only a \\nsmall fraction of those that are syntactically possible. Therefore, by focusing only \\non training examples encountered in practice, the program is likely to develop a \\nsmaller, more relevant set of rules than if it attempted to enumerate all possible \\nlemmas about chess. \\nThe second question that arises is whether PROLOG-EBG can ever learn a \\nhypothesis that goes beyond the knowledge that is already implicit in the domain \\ntheory. Put another way, will it ever learn to classify an instance that could not \\nbe classified by the original domain theory (assuming a theorem prover with \\nunbounded computational resources)? Unfortunately, it will not. If B F h, then \\nany classification entailed by h will also be entailed by B. Is this an inherent \\nlimitation of analytical or deductive learning methods? No, it is not, as illustrated \\nby the following example. \\nTo produce an instance of deductive learning in which the learned hypothesis \\nh entails conclusions that are not entailed by B, we must create an example where \\nB y h but where D A B F h (recall the constraint given by Equation (11.2)). \\nOne interesting case is when B contains assertions such as \"If x satisfies the \\ntarget concept, then so will g(x).\" Taken alone, this assertion does not entail the \\nclassification of any instances. However, once we observe a positive example, it \\nallows generalizing deductively to other unseen instances. For example, consider \\nlearning the PlayTennis target concept, describing the days on which our friend \\nRoss would like to play tennis. Imagine that each day is described only by the \\nsingle attribute Humidity, and the domain theory B includes the single assertion \\n\"If Ross likes to play tennis when the humidity is x, then he will also like to play \\ntennis when the humidity is lower than x,\" which can be stated more formally as \\n(Vx) IF ((PlayTennis = Yes) t (Humidity = x)) \\nTHEN ((PlayTennis = Yes) t (Humidity 5 x)) \\nNote that this domain theory does not entail any conclusions regarding which \\ninstances are positive or negative instances of PlayTennis.

The learned hypothesis in this case entails predictions that are not \\nentailed by the domain theory alone. The phrase knowledge-level learning is some- \\ntimes used to refer to this type of learning, in which the learned hypothesis entails \\npredictions that go beyond those entailed by the domain theory. The set of all \\npredictions entailed by a set of assertions Y is often called the deductive closure \\nof Y. The key distinction here is that in knowledge-level learning the deductive \\nclosure of B is a proper subset of the deductive closure of B + h. \\nA second example of knowledge-level analytical learning is provided by con- \\nsidering a type of assertions known as determinations, which have been explored \\nin detail by Russell (1989) and others. Determinations assert that some attribute of \\nthe instance is fully determined by certain other attributes, without specifying the \\nexact nature of the dependence. For example, consider learning the target concept \\n\"people who speak Portuguese,\" and imagine we are given as a domain theory the \\nsingle determination assertion \"the language spoken by a person is determined by \\ntheir nationality.\" Taken alone, this domain theory does not enable us to classify \\nany instances as positive or negative. However, if we observe that \"Joe, a 23- \\nyear-old left-handed Brazilian, speaks Portuguese,\" then we can conclude from \\nthis positive example and the domain theory that \"all Brazilians speak Portuguese.\" \\nBoth of these examples illustrate how deductive learning can produce output \\nhypotheses that are not entailed by the domain theory alone. In both of these cases, \\nthe output hypothesis h satisfies B A D I- h, but does not satisfy B I- h. In both \\ncases, the learner deduces a justified hypothesis that does not follow from either \\nthe domain theory alone or the training data alone. \\n11.4 EXPLANATION-BASED LEARNING OF SEARCH CONTROL \\nKNOWLEDGE \\nAs noted above, the practical applicability of the PROLOG-EBG algorithm is re- \\nstricted by its requirement that the domain theory be correct and complete. One \\nimportant class of learning problems where this requirement is easily satisfied is \\nlearning to speed up complex search programs. In fact, the largest scale attempts to \\napply explanation-based learning have addressed the problem of learning to con- \\ntrol search, or what is sometimes called \"speedup\" learning. For example, playing \\ngames such as chess involves searching through a vast space of possible moves \\nand board positions to find the best move. Many practical scheduling and optimiza- \\ntion problems are easily formulated as large search problems, in which the task is \\nto find some move toward the goal state. In such problems the definitions of the \\nlegal search operators, together with the definition of the search objective, provide \\na complete and correct domain theory for learning search control knowledge.'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'macOS Version 11.2.3 (Build 20D91) Quartz PDFContext', 'creator': 'Preview', 'creationdate': \"D:20210312135113Z00'00'\", 'title': 'Machine - Learning - Tom Mitchell.pdf', 'moddate': \"D:20210312135113Z00'00'\", 'source': '..\\\\Data\\\\PDFiles\\\\MachineLearningTomMitchell.pdf', 'total_pages': 421, 'page': 337, 'page_label': '338'}, page_content='Exactly how should we formulate the problem of learning search control so \\nthat we can apply explanation-based learning?

The problem in general is to find a sequence \\nof operators that will transform an arbitrary initial state si to some final state sf \\nthat satisfies the goal predicate G. One way to formulate the learning problem is to \\nhave our system learn a separate target concept for each of the operators in 0.

It then solves problems of the form \"find a sequence \\nof operators that leads from initial state si to a state that satisfies goal predicate \\nG.\" PRODIGY uses a means-ends planner that decomposes problems into subgoals, \\nsolves them, then combines their solutions into a solution for the full problem. \\nThus, during its search for problem solutions PRODIGY repeatedly faces questions \\nsuch as \"Which subgoal should be solved next?\\'and \"Which operator should \\nbe considered for solving this subgoal?\\' Minton (1988) describes the integration \\nof explanation-based learning into PRODIGY by defining a set of target concepts \\nappropriate for these kinds of control decisions that it repeatedly confronts. For \\nexample, one target concept is \"the set of states in which subgoal A should be \\nsolved before subgoal B.\" An example of a rule learned by PRODIGY for this target \\nconcept in a simple block-stacking problem domain is \\nIF One subgoal to be solved is On@, y), and \\nOne subgoal to be solved is On(y, z) \\nTHEN Solve the subgoal On(y, z) before On(x, y) \\nTo understand this rule, consider again the simple block stacking problem illus- \\ntrated in Figure 9.3. In the problem illustrated by that figure, the goal is to stack \\nthe blocks so that they spell the word \"universal.\" PRODIGY would decompose this \\nproblem into several subgoals to be achieved, including On(U, N), On(N, I), etc. \\nNotice the above rule matches the subgoals On(U, N) and On(N, I), and recom- \\nmends solving the subproblem On(N, I) before solving On(U, N). The justifica- \\ntion for this rule (and the explanation used by PRODIGY to learn the rule) is that \\nif we solve the subgoals in the reverse sequence, we will encounter a conflict in \\nwhich we must undo the solution to the On(U, N) subgoal in order to achieve the \\nother subgoal On(N, I).

The net effect is that PRODIGY uses domain-independent knowledge about \\npossible subgoal conflicts, together with domain-specific knowledge of specific \\noperators (e.g., the fact that the robot can pick up only one block at a time), to \\nlearn useful domain-specific planning rules such as the one illustrated above. \\nThe use of explanation-based learning to acquire control knowledge for \\nPRODIGY has been demonstrated in a variety of problem domains including the \\nsimple block-stacking problem above, as well as more complex scheduling and \\nplanning problems. Minton (1988) reports experiments in three problem domains, \\nin which the learned control rules improve problem-solving efficiency by a factor \\nof two to four. Furthermore, the performance of these learned rules is comparable \\nto that of handwritten rules across these three problem domains. Minton also de- \\nscribes a number of extensions to the basic explanation-based learning procedure \\nthat improve its effectiveness for learning control knowledge. These include meth- \\nods for simplifying learned rules and for removing learned rules whose benefits \\nare smaller than their cost. \\nA second example of a general problem-solving architecture that incorpo- \\nrates a form of explanation-based learning is the SOAR system (Laird et al. 1986; \\nNewel1 1990). SOAR supports a broad variety of problem-solving strategies that \\nsubsumes PRODIGY'S means-ends planning strategy. Like PRODIGY, however, SOAR \\nlearns by explaining situations in which its current search strategy leads to ineffi- \\nciencies. When it encounters a search choice for which it does not have a definite \\nanswer (e.g., which operator to apply next) SOAR reflects on this search impasse, \\nusing weak methods such as generate-and-test to determine the correct course of \\naction. The reasoning used to resolve this impasse can be interpreted as an expla- \\nnation for how to resolve similar impasses in the future. SOAR uses a variant of \\nexplanation-based learning called chunking to extract the general conditions un- \\nder which the same explanation applies. SOAR has been applied in a great number \\nof problem domains and has also been proposed as a psychologically plausible \\nmodel of human learning processes (see Newel1 1990). \\nPRODIGY and SOAR demonstrate that explanation-based learning methods can \\nbe successfully applied to acquire search control knowledge in a variety of problem \\ndomains. Nevertheless, many or most heuristic search programs still use numerical \\nevaluation functions similar to the one described in Chapter 1, rather than rules \\nacquired by explanation-based learning. What is the reason for this? In fact, there \\nare significant practical problems with applying EBL to learning search control. \\nFirst, in many cases the number of control rules that must be learned is very large \\n(e.g., many thousands of rules). As the system learns more and more control rules \\nto improve its search, it must pay a larger and larger cost at each step to match this \\nset of rules against the current search state. Note this problem is not specific to \\nexplanation-based learning; it will occur for any system that represents its learned \\nknowledge by a growing set of rules. Efficient algorithms for matching rules can \\nalleviate this problem, but not eliminate it completely. Minton (1988) discusses \\nstrategies for empirically estimating the computational cost and benefit of each \\nrule, learning rules only when the estimated benefits outweigh the estimated costs\"), Document(metadata={'producer': 'macOS Version 11.2.3 (Build 20D91) Quartz PDFContext', 'creator': 'Preview', 'creationdate': \"D:20210312135113Z00'00'\", 'title': 'Machine - Learning - Tom Mitchell.pdf', 'moddate': \"D:20210312135113Z00'00'\", 'source': '..\\\\Data\\\\PDFiles\\\\MachineLearningTomMitchell.pdf', 'total_pages': 421, 'page': 339, 'page_label': '340'}, page_content='and deleting rules later found to have negative utility. He describes how using \\nthis kind of utility analysis to determine what should be learned and what should \\nbe forgotten significantly enhances the effectiveness of explanation-based learning \\nin PRODIGY. For example, in a series of robot block-stacking problems, PRODIGY \\nencountered 328 opportunities for learning a new rule, but chose to exploit only 69 \\nof these, and eventually reduced the learned rules to a set of 19, once low-utility \\nrules were eliminated. Tambe et al. (1990) and Doorenbos (1993) discuss how to \\nidentify types of rules that will be particularly costly to match, as well as methods \\nfor re-expressing such rules in more efficient forms and methods for optimizing \\nrule-matching algorithms. Doorenbos (1993) describes how these methods enabled \\nSOAR to efficiently match a set of 100,000 learned rules in one problem domain, \\nwithout a significant increase in the cost of matching rules per state. \\nA second practical problem with applying explanation-based learning to \\nlearning search control is that in many cases it is intractable even to construct \\nthe explanations for the desired target concept. For example, in chess we might \\nwish to learn a target concept such as \"states for which operator A leads toward \\nthe optimal solution.\" Unfortunately, to prove or explain why A leads toward the \\noptimal solution requires explaining that every alternative operator leads to a less \\noptimal outcome. This typically requires effort exponential in the search depth. \\nChien (1993) and Tadepalli (1990) explore methods for \"lazy\" or \"incremental\" \\nexplanation, in which heuristics are used to produce partial and approximate, but \\ntractable, explanations. Rules are extracted from these imperfect explanations as \\nthough the explanations were perfect. Of course these learned rules may be in- \\ncorrect due to the incomplete explanations. The system accommodates this by \\nmonitoring the performance of the rule on subsequent cases. If the rule subse- \\nquently makes an error, then the original explanation is incrementally elaborated \\nto cover the new case, and a more refined rule is extracted from this incrementally \\nimproved explanation. \\nMany additional research efforts have explored the use of explanation-based \\nlearning for improving the efficiency of search-based problem solvers (for exam- \\nple, Mitchell 1981; Silver 1983; Shavlik 1990; Mahadevan et al. 1993; Gervasio \\nand DeJong 1994; DeJong 1994). Bennett and DeJong (1996) explore explanation- \\nbased learning for robot planning problems where the system has an imperfect \\ndomain theory that describes its world and actions. Dietterich and Flann (1995) \\nexplore the integration of explanation-based learning with reinforcement learning \\nmethods discussed in Chapter 13. Mitchell and Thrun (1993) describe the appli- \\ncation of an explanation-based neural network learning method (see the EBNN \\nalgorithm discussed in Chapter 12) to reinforcement learning problems. \\n11.5 SUMMARY AND FURTHER READING \\nThe main points of this chapter include: \\nIn contrast to purely inductive learning methods that seek a hypothesis to \\nfit the training data, purely analytical learning methods seek a hypothesis'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'macOS Version 11.2.3 (Build 20D91) Quartz PDFContext', 'creator': 'Preview', 'creationdate': \"D:20210312135113Z00'00'\", 'title': 'Machine - Learning - Tom Mitchell.pdf', 'moddate': \"D:20210312135113Z00'00'\", 'source': '..\\\\Data\\\\PDFiles\\\\MachineLearningTomMitchell.pdf', 'total_pages': 421, 'page': 340, 'page_label': '341'}, page_content='that fits the learner\\'s prior knowledge and covers the training examples. \\nHumans often make use of prior knowledge to guide the formation of new \\nhypotheses. This chapter examines purely analytical learning methods. The \\nnext chapter examines combined inductive-analytical learning. \\na Explanation-based learning is a form of analytical learning in which the \\nlearner processes each novel training example by (1) explaining the observed \\ntarget value for this example in terms of the domain theory, (2) analyzing this \\nexplanation to determine the general conditions under which the explanation \\nholds, and (3) refining its hypothesis to incorporate these general conditions. \\na PROLOG-EBG is an explanation-based learning algorithm that uses first-order \\nHorn clauses to represent both its domain theory and its learned hypothe- \\nses. In PROLOG-EBG an explanation is a PROLOG proof, and the hypothesis \\nextracted from the explanation is the weakest preimage of this proof. As a \\nresult, the hypotheses output by PROLOG-EBG follow deductively from its \\ndomain theory. \\na Analytical learning methods such as PROLOG-EBG construct useful interme- \\ndiate features as a side effect of analyzing individual training examples. This \\nanalytical approach to feature generation complements the statistically based \\ngeneration of intermediate features (eg., hidden unit features) in inductive \\nmethods such as BACKPROPAGATION. \\na Although PROLOG-EBG does not produce hypotheses that extend the deduc- \\ntive closure of its domain theory, other deductive learning procedures can. \\nFor example, a domain theory containing determination assertions (e.g., \"na- \\ntionality determines language\") can be used together with observed data to \\ndeductively infer hypotheses that go beyond the deductive closure of the \\ndomain theory. \\na One important class of problems for which a correct and complete domain \\ntheory can be found is the class of large state-space search problems. Systems \\nsuch as PRODIGY and SOAR have demonstrated the utility of explanation- \\nbased learning methods for automatically acquiring effective search control \\nknowledge that speeds up problem solving in subsequent cases. \\na Despite the apparent usefulness of explanation-based learning methods in \\nhumans, purely deductive implementations such as PROLOG-EBG suffer the \\ndisadvantage that the output hypothesis is only as correct as the domain \\ntheory. In the next chapter we examine approaches that combine inductive \\nand analytical learning methods in order to learn effectively from imperfect \\ndomain theories and limited training data. \\nThe roots of analytical learning methods can be traced to early work by \\nFikes et al. (1972) on learning macro-operators through analysis of operators \\nin ABSTRIPS and to somewhat later work by Soloway (1977) on the use of \\nexplicit prior knowledge in learning. Explanation-based learning methods similar \\nto those discussed in this chapter first appeared in a number of systems developed \\nduring the early 1980s, including DeJong (1981); Mitchell (1981); Winston et al.'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'macOS Version 11.2.3 (Build 20D91) Quartz PDFContext', 'creator': 'Preview', 'creationdate': \"D:20210312135113Z00'00'\", 'title': 'Machine - Learning - Tom Mitchell.pdf', 'moddate': \"D:20210312135113Z00'00'\", 'source': '..\\\\Data\\\\PDFiles\\\\MachineLearningTomMitchell.pdf', 'total_pages': 421, 'page': 341, 'page_label': '342'}, page_content='(1983); and Silver (1983). DeJong and Mooney (1986) and Mitchell et al. (1986) \\nprovided general descriptions of the explanation-based learning paradigm, which \\nhelped spur a burst of research on this topic during the late 1980s. A collection of \\nresearch on explanation-based learning performed at the University of Illinois is \\ndescribed by DeJong (1993), including algorithms that modify the structure of the \\nexplanation in order to correctly generalize iterative and temporal explanations. \\nMore recent research has focused on extending explanation-based methods to \\naccommodate imperfect domain theories and to incorporate inductive together \\nwith analytical learning (see Chapter 12). An edited collection exploring the role \\nof goals and prior knowledge in human and machine learning is provided by Ram \\nand Leake (1995), and a recent overview of explanation-based learning is given \\nby DeJong (1997). \\nThe most serious attempts to employ explanation-based learning with perfect \\ndomain theories have been in the area of learning search control, or \"speedup\" \\nlearning. The SOAR system described by Laird et al. (1986) and the PRODIGY \\nsystem described by Carbonell et al. (1990) are among the most developed sys- \\ntems that use explanation-based learning methods for learning in problem solv- \\ning. Rosenbloom and Laird (1986) discuss the close relationship between SOAR\\'S \\nlearning method (called \"chunking\") and other explanation-based learning meth- \\nods. More recently, Dietterich and Flann (1995) have explored the combination \\nof explanation-based learning with reinforcement learning methods for learning \\nsearch control. \\nWhile our primary purpose here is to study machine learning algorithms, it \\nis interesting to note that experimental studies of human learning provide support \\nfor the conjecture that human learning is based on explanations. For example, \\nAhn et al. (1987) and Qin et al. (1992) summarize evidence supporting the con- \\njecture that humans employ explanation-based learning processes. Wisniewski and \\nMedin (1995) describe experimental studies of human learning that suggest a rich \\ninterplay between prior knowledge and observed data to influence the learning \\nprocess. Kotovsky and Baillargeon (1994) describe experiments that suggest even \\n1 1-month old infants build on prior knowledge as they learn. \\nThe analysis performed in explanation-based learning is similar to certain \\nkinds of program optimization methods used for PROLOG programs, such as par- \\ntial evaluation; van Harmelen and Bundy (1988) provide one discussion of the \\nrelationship. \\nEXERCISES \\n11.1.

Purely analytical methods use prior \\nknowledge to derive general hypotheses deductively., This chapter considers meth- \\nods that combine inductive and analytical mechanisms to obtain the benefits of both \\napproaches: better generalization accuracy when prior knowledge is available and re- \\nliance on observed training data to overcome shortcomings in prior knowledge. The \\nresulting combined methods outperform both purely inductive and purely analyti- \\ncal learning methods. This chapter considers inductive-analytical learning methods \\nbased on both symbolic and artificial neural network representations. \\n12.1 MOTIVATION \\nIn previous chapters we have seen two paradigms for machine learning: inductive \\nlearning and analytical learning. Inductive methods, such as decision tree induc- \\ntion and neural network BACKPROPAGATION, seek general hypotheses that fit the \\nobserved training data.

This chapter considers the question of how \\nto combine the two into a single algorithm that captures the best aspects of \\nboth. \\nThe difference between inductive and analytical learning methods can be \\nseen in the nature of the justiJications that can be given for their learned hypothe- \\nses. Hypotheses output by purely analytical learning methods such as PROLOG- \\nEBG carry a logical justification; the output hypothesis follows deductively from \\nthe domain theory and training examples. Hypotheses output by purely inductive \\nlearning methods such as BACKPROPAGATION carry a statistical justification; the \\noutput hypothesis follows from statistical arguments that the training sample is \\nsufficiently large that it is probably representative of the underlying distribution \\nof examples. This statistical justification for induction is clearly articulated in the \\nPAC-learning results discussed in Chapter 7. \\nGiven that analytical methods provide logically justified hypotheses and in- \\nductive methods provide statistically justified hypotheses, it is easy to see why \\ncombining them would be useful: Logical justifications are only as compelling as \\nthe assumptions, or prior knowledge, on which they are built. They are suspect or \\npowerless if prior knowledge is incorrect or unavailable. Statistical justifications \\nare only as compelling as the data and statistical assumptions on which they rest. \\nThey are suspect or powerless when assumptions about the underlying distribu- \\ntions cannot be trusted or when data is scarce. In short, the two approaches work \\nwell for different types of problems. By combining them we can hope to devise \\na more general learning approach that covers a more broad range of learning \\ntasks. \\nFigure 12.1 summarizes a spectrum of learning problems that varies by the \\navailability of prior knowledge and training data.

The result, however, is a purely inductive instantiation of BACKPROPA- \\nGATION, specialized by the designer\\'s choices to the task of speech recognition. \\nOur interest here lies in something different.

Recall from Chapter 5 that errorD(h) is defined to be the \\nproportion of examples from D that are misclassified by h. Let us define the error \\nerror~(h) of h with respect to a domain theory B to be the probability that h \\nwill disagree with B on the classification of a randomly drawn instance. We can \\nattempt to characterize the desired output hypothesis in terms of these errors. For \\nexample, we could require the hypothesis that minimizes some combined measure \\nof these errors, such as \\nargmin kDerrorD (h) + kBerrorB (h) \\nh€ H \\nWhile this appears reasonable at first glance, it is not clear what values to assign \\nto k~ and kg to specify the relative importance of fitting the data versus fitting the \\ntheory. If we have a very poor theory and a great deal of reliable data, it will be \\nbest to weight error~(h) more heavily. Given a strong theory and a small sample \\nof very noisy data, the best results would be obtained by weighting errorB(h) \\nmore heavily. Of course if the learner does not know in advance the quality of \\nthe domain theory or training data, it will be unclear how it should weight these \\ntwo error components. \\nAn alternative perspective on the question of how to weight prior knowl- \\nedge and data is the Bayesian perspective. Recall from Chapter 6 that Bayes \\ntheorem describes how to compute the posterior probability P(h1D) of hypothe- \\nsis h given observed training data D. In particular, Bayes theorem computes this \\nposterior probability based on the observed data D, together with prior knowledge \\nin the form of P(h), P(D), and P(Dlh). Thus we can think of P(h), P(D), and \\nP(Dlh) as a form of background knowledge or domain theory, and we can think \\nof Bayes theorem as a method for weighting this domain theory, together with \\nthe observed data D, to assign a posterior probability P(hlD) to h. The Bayesian \\nview is that one should simply choose the hypothesis whose posterior probability \\nis greatest, and that Bayes theorem provides the proper method for weighting \\nthe contribution of this prior knowledge and observed data. Unfortunately, Bayes \\ntheorem implicitly assumes pe$ect knowledge about the probability distributions \\nP(h), P(D), and P(Dlh). When these quantities are only imperfectly known, \\nBayes theorem alone does not prescribe how to combine them with the observed \\ndata. (One possible approach in such cases is to assume prior probability distri- \\nbutions over P(h), P(D), and P(D1h) themselves, then calculate the expected \\nvalue of the posterior P (h 1 D) . However, this requires additional knowledge about \\nthe priors over P(h), P(D), and P(Dlh), so it does not really solve the general \\nproblem.) \\nWe will revisit the question of what we mean by \"best\" fit to the hypothesis \\nand data as we examine specific algorithms.

This remains an open question in machine \\nlearning. This chapter surveys a variety of approaches that have been proposed, \\nmany of which consist of extensions to inductive methods we have already studied \\n(e.g., BACKPROPAGATION, FOIL). \\nOne way to understand the range of possible approaches is to return to our \\nview of learning as a task of searching through the space of alternative hypotheses. \\nWe can characterize most learning methods as search algorithms by describing \\nthe hypothesis space H they search, the initial hypothesis ho at which they begin \\ntheir search, the set of search operators 0 that define individual search steps, and \\nthe goal criterion G that specifies the search objective. In this chapter we explore \\nthree different methods for using prior knowledge to alter the search performed \\nby purely inductive methods. \\nUse prior knowledge to derive an initial hypothesis from which to begin the \\nsearch. In this approach the domain theory B is used to construct an ini- \\ntial hypothesis ho that is consistent with B. A standard inductive method \\nis then applied, starting with the initial hypothesis ho. For example, the \\nKBANN system described below learns artificial neural networks in this \\nway. It uses prior knowledge to design the interconnections and weights \\nfor an initial network, so that this initial network is perfectly consistent \\nwith the given domain theory. This initial network hypothesis is then re- \\nfined inductively using the BACKPROPAGATION algorithm and available data. \\nBeginning the search at a hypothesis consistent with the domain theory \\nmakes it more likely that the final output hypothesis will better fit this \\ntheory. \\nUse prior knowledge to alter the objective of the hypothesis space search. \\nIn this approach, the goal criterion G is modified to require that the out- \\nput hypothesis fits the domain theory as well as the training examples. For \\nexample, the EBNN system described below learns neural networks in this \\nway. Whereas inductive learning of neural networks performs gradient de- \\nscent search to minimize the squared error of the network over the training \\ndata, EBNN performs gradient descent to optimize a different criterion. This \\nmodified criterion includes an additional term that measures the error of the \\nlearned network relative to the domain theory. \\n0 Use prior knowledge to alter the available search steps. In this approach, the \\nset of search operators 0 is altered by the domain theory. For example, the \\nFOCL system described below learns sets of Horn clauses in this way. It is \\nbased on the inductive system FOIL, which conducts a greedy search through \\nthe space of possible Horn clauses, at each step revising its current hypoth- \\nesis by adding a single new literal.

This approach is used by the KBANN (Knowledge-Based Artificial \\nNeural Network) algorithm to learn artificial neural networks. In KBANN an initial \\nnetwork is first constructed so that for every possible instance, the classification \\nassigned by the network is identical to that assigned by the domain theory. The \\nBACKPROPAGATION algorithm is then employed to adjust the weights of this initial \\nnetwork as needed to fit the training examples. \\nIt is easy to see the motivation for this technique: if the domain theory is \\ncorrect, the initial hypothesis will correctly classify all the training examples and \\nthere will be no need to revise it. However, if the initial hypothesis is found \\nto imperfectly classify the training examples, then it will be refined inductively \\nto improve its fit to the training examples. Recall that in the purely inductive \\nBACKPROPAGATION algorithm, weights are typically initialized to small random \\nvalues. The intuition behind KBANN is that even if the domain theory is only \\napproximately correct, initializing the network to fit this domain theory will give a \\nbetter starting approximation to the target function than initializing the network to \\nrandom initial weights. This should lead, in turn, to better generalization accuracy \\nfor the final hypothesis. \\nThis initialize-the-hypothesis approach to using the domain theory has been \\nexplored by several researchers, including Shavlik and Towel1 (1989), Towel1 \\nand Shavlik (1994), Fu (1989, 1993), and Pratt (1993a, 1993b). We will use \\nthe KBANN algorithm described in Shavlik and Towel1 (1989) to illustrate this \\napproach. \\n12.3.1 The KBANN Algorithm \\nThe KBANN algorithm exemplifies the initialize-the-hypothesis approach to using \\ndomain theories.

Nevertheless, the domain theory forms a useful approximation to \\nthe target concept. KBANN uses the domain theory and training examples together \\nto learn the target concept more accurately than it could from either alone. \\nIn the first stage of the KBANN algorithm (steps 1-3 in the algorithm), an \\ninitial network is constructed that is consistent with the domain theory. For exam- \\nple, the network constructed from the Cup domain theory is shown in Figure 12.2. \\nIn general the network is constructed by creating a sigmoid threshold unit for each \\nHorn clause in the domain theory. KBANN follows the convention that a sigmoid \\noutput value greater than 0.5 is interpreted as True and a value below 0.5 as False. \\nEach unit is therefore constructed so that its output will be greater than 0.5 just \\nin those cases where the corresponding Horn clause applies.

When \\nunit input values are 1 or 0, this assures that their weighted sum plus wo will be \\npositive (and the sigmoid output will therefore be greater than 0.5) if and only if \\nall clause antecedents are satisfied. Note for sigmoid units at the second and sub- \\nsequent layers, unit inputs will not necessarily be 1 and 0 and the above argument \\nmay not apply. However, if a sufficiently large value is chosen for W, this KBANN \\nalgorithm can correctly encode the domain theory for arbitrarily deep networks. \\nTowell and Shavlik (1994) report using W = 4.0 in many of their experiments. \\nEach sigmoid unit input is connected to the appropriate network input or to \\nthe output of another sigmoid unit, to mirror the graph of dependencies among \\nthe corresponding attributes in the domain theory. As a final step many additional \\ninputs are added to each threshold unit, with their weights set approximately to \\nzero. The role of these additional connections is to enable the network to induc- \\ntively learn additional dependencies beyond those suggested by the given domain \\ntheory.

It is easy to verify that for sufficiently large values of W this \\nnetwork will output values identical to the predictions of the domain theory. \\nThe second stage of KBANN (step 4 in the algorithm of Table 12.2) uses \\nthe training examples and the BACWROPAGATION algorithm to refine the initial \\nnetwork weights. Of course if the domain theory and training examples contain \\nno errors, the initial network will already fit the training data.

In particular, it \\ndiscusses how the EBNN algorithm constructs explanations of individual train- \\ning examples in order to extract training derivatives for use by TANGENTPROP. \\nTANGENTPROP and EBNN have been demonstrated to outperform purely inductive \\nmethods in a variety of domains, including character and object recognition, and \\nrobot perception and control tasks. \\n12.4.1 The TANGENTPROP Algorithm \\nTANGENTPROP (Simard et al. 1992) accommodates domain knowledge expressed \\nas derivatives of the target function with respect to transformations of its inputs. \\nConsider a learning task involving an instance space X and target function f. Up \\nto now we have assumed that each training example consists of a pair (xi, f (xi)) \\nthat describes some instance xi and its training value f (xi). The TANGENTPROP \\nalgorithm assumes various training derivatives of the target function are also \\nprovided. For example, if each instance xi is described by a single real value, \\nthen each training example may be of the form (xi, f (xi), q lx, ). Here lx, \\ndenotes the derivative of the target function f with respect to x, evaluated at the \\npoint x = xi. \\nTo develop an intuition for the benefits of providing training derivatives as \\nwell as training values during learning, consider the simple learning task depicted \\nin Figure 12.5. The task is to learn the target function f shown in the leftmost plot \\nof the figure, based on the three training examples shown: (xl, f (xl)), (x2, f (x2)), \\nand (xg, f (xg)). Given these three training examples, the BACKPROPAGATION algo- \\nrithm can be expected to hypothesize a smooth function, such as the function g \\ndepicted in the middle plot of the figure.

By fitting both the training values f (xi) \\nand these training derivatives PI,, the learner has a better chance to correctly \\ngeneralize from the sparse training data. To summarize, the impact of including \\nthe training derivatives is to override the usual syntactic inductive bias of BACK- \\nPROPAGATION that favors a smooth interpolation between points, replacing it by \\nexplicit input information about required derivatives. The resulting hypothesis h \\nshown in the rightmost plot of the figure provides a much more accurate estimate \\nof the true target function f. \\nIn the above example, we considered only simple kinds of derivatives of \\nthe target function. In fact, TANGENTPROP can accept training derivatives with \\nrespect to various transformations of the input x. Consider, for example, the task \\nof learning to recognize handwritten characters. In particular, assume the input \\nx corresponds to an image containing a single handwritten character, and the \\ntask is to correctly classify the character. In this task, we might be interested in \\ninforming the learner that \"the target function is invariant to small rotations of \\nthe character within the image.\" In order to express this prior knowledge to the \\nlearner, we first define a transformation s(a, x), which rotates the image x by a! \\ndegrees. Now we can express our assertion about rotational invariance by stating \\nthat for each training instance xi, the derivative of the target function with respect \\nto this transformation is zero (i.e., that rotating the input image does not alter the \\nvalue of the target function). In other words, we can assert the following training \\nderivative for every training instance xi \\naf ($(a, xi)) =o aa \\nwhere f is the target function and s(a, xi) is the image resulting from applying \\nthe transformation s to the image xi. \\nHow are such training derivatives used by TANGENTPROP to constrain the \\nweights of the neural network?

In general, TANGENTPROP accepts multi- \\nple transformations (e.g., we might wish to assert both rotational invariance and \\ntranslational invariance of the character identity).

It combines \\nthis prior knowledge with observed training data, by minimizing an objective func- \\ntion that measures both the network's error with respect to the training example \\nvalues (fitting the data) and its error with respect to the desired derivatives (fitting \\nthe prior knowledge). The value of p determines the degree to which the network \\nwill fit one or the other of these two components in the total error. The behavior \\nof the algorithm is sensitive to p, which must be chosen by the designer. \\nAlthough TANGENTPROP succeeds in combining prior knowledge with train- \\ning data to guide learning of neural networks, it is not robust to errors in the prior \\nknowledge. Consider what will happen when prior knowledge is incorrect, that \\nis, when the training derivatives input to the learner do not correctly reflect the \\nderivatives of the true target function. In this case the algorithm will attempt to fit \\nincorrect derivatives. It may therefore generalize less accurately than if it ignored \\nthis prior knowledge altogether and used the purely inductive BACKPROPAGATION \\nalgorithm. If we knew in advance the degree of error in the training derivatives, \\nwe might use this information to select the constant p that determines the relative \\nimportance of fitting training values and fitting training derivatives. However, this \\ninformation is unlikely to be known in advance. In the next section we discuss \\nthe EBNN algorithm, which automatically selects values for p on an example-by- \\nexample basis in order to address the possibility of incorrect prior knowledge. \\nIt is interesting to compare the search through hypothesis space (weight \\nspace) performed by TANGENTPROP, KBANN, and BACKPROPAGATION. TANGENT- \\nPROP incorporates prior knowledge to influence the hypothesis search by altering \\nthe objective function to be minimized by gradient descent. This corresponds to \\naltering the goal of the hypothesis space search, as illustrated in Figure 12.6. Like \\nBACKPROPAGATION (but unlike KBANN), TANGENTPROP begins the search with an \\ninitial network of small random weights. However, the gradient descent training \\nrule produces different weight updates than BACKPROPAGATION, resulting in a dif- \\nferent final hypothesis. As shown in the figure, the set of hypotheses that minimizes \\nthe TANGENTPROP objective may differ from the set that minimizes the BACKPROP- \\nAGATION objective. Importantly, if the training examples and prior knowledge are \\nboth correct, and the target function can be accurately represented by the ANN, \\nthen the set of weight vectors that satisfy the TANGENTPROP objective will be a \\nsubset of those satisfying the weaker BACKPROPAGATION objective. The difference \\nbetween these two sets of final hypotheses is the set of incorrect hypotheses that \\nwill be considered by BACKPROPAGATION, but ruled out by TANGENTPROP due to \\nits prior knowledge. \\nNote one alternative to fitting the training derivatives of the target function \\nis to simply synthesize additional training examples near the observed training \\nexamples, using the known training derivatives to estimate training values for \\nthese nearby instances.

First, instead of relying on the user to provide training derivatives, EBNN \\ncomputes training derivatives itself for each observed training example. These \\ntraining derivatives are calculated by explaining each training example in terms \\nof a given domain theory, then extracting training derivatives from this explana- \\ntion. Second, EBNN addresses the issue of how to weight the relative importance \\nof the inductive and analytical components of learning (i.e., how to select the \\nparameter p in Equation [12.1]). The value of p is chosen independently for each \\ntraining example, based on a heuristic that considers how accurately the domain \\ntheory predicts the training value for this particular example.

The output of EBNN is a new neural network that approximates the \\ntarget function f. This learned network is trained to fit both the training examples \\n(xi, f (xi)) and training derivatives of f extracted from the domain theory. Fitting \\nthe training examples (xi, f (xi)) constitutes the inductive component of learning, \\nwhereas fitting the training derivatives extracted from the domain theory provides \\nthe analytical component. \\nTo illustrate the type of domain theory used by EBNN, consider Figure 12.7. \\nThe top portion of this figure depicts an EBNN domain theory for the target func- \\ntion Cup, with each rectangular block representing a distinct neural network in the \\ndomain theory. Notice in this example there is one network for each of the Horn \\nclauses in the symbolic domain theory of Table 12.3. For example, the network \\nlabeled Graspable takes as input the description of an instance and produces as \\noutput a value indicating whether the object is graspable (EBNN typically repre- \\nsents true propositions by the value 0.8 and false propositions by the value 0.2). \\nThis network is analogous to the Horn clause for Graspable given in Table 12.3. \\nSome networks take the outputs of other networks as their inputs (e.g., the right- \\nmost network labeled Cup takes its inputs from the outputs of the Stable, Lifable, \\nand OpenVessel networks). Thus, the networks that make up the domain theory \\ncan be chained together to infer the target function value for the input instance, \\njust as Horn clauses might be chained together for this purpose. In general, these \\ndomain theory networks may be provided to the learner by some external source, \\nor they may be the result of previous learning by the same system.

In the more general case where the target function has multiple \\noutput units, the gradient is computed for each of these outputs. This matrix of \\ngradients is called the Jacobian of the target function. \\nTo see the importance of these training derivatives in helping to learn the \\ntarget network, consider the derivative ,E~~~i,,e. If the domain theory encodes \\nthe knowledge that the feature Expensive is irrelevant to the target function Cup, \\nthen the derivative ,E~~e~i,,e extracted from the explanation will have the value \\nzero. A derivative of zero corresponds to the assertion that a change in the fea- \\nture Expensive will have no impact on the predicted value of Cup. On the other \\nhand, a large positive or negative derivative corresponds to the assertion that the \\nfeature is highly relevant to determining the target value. Thus, the derivatives \\nextracted from the domain theory explanation provide important information for \\ndistinguishing relevant from irrelevant features. When these extracted derivatives \\nare provided as training derivatives to TANGENTPROP for learning the target net- \\nwork Cup,,,,,,, they provide a useful bias for guiding generalization. The usual \\nsyntactic inductive bias of neural network learning is replaced in this case by the \\nbias exerted by the derivatives obtained from the domain theory. \\nAbove we described how the domain theory prediction can be used to gen- \\nerate a set of training derivatives. To be more precise, the full EBNN algorithm \\nis as follows. Given the training examples and domain theory, EBNN first cre- \\nates a new, fully connected feedforward network to represent the target function. \\nThis target network is initialized with small random weights, just as in BACK- \\nPROPAGATION. Next, for each training example (xi, f (xi)) EBNN determines the \\ncorresponding training derivatives in a two-step process. First, it uses the domain \\ntheory to predict the value of the target function for instance xi. Let A(xi) de- \\nnote this domain theory prediction for instance xi. In other words, A(xi) is the \\nfunction defined by the composition of the domain theory networks forming the \\nexplanation for xi. Second, the weights and activations of the domain theory net- \\nworks are analyzed to extract the derivatives of A(xi) 'with respect to each of the \\ncomponents of xi (i.e., the Jacobian of A(x) evaluated at x = xi). Extracting these \\nderivatives follows a process very similar to calculating the 6 terms in the BACK- \\nPROPAGATION algorithm (see Exercise 12.5).

These training \\nderivatives are provided to a variant of TANGENTPROP, which fits the target network \\nto these derivatives and to the training example values. Fitting the derivatives \\nconstrains the learned network to fit dependencies given by the domain theory, \\nwhile fitting the training values constrains it to fit the observed data itself.

Recall from that chapter that \\nPROLOG-EBG also constructs explanations (predictions of example target values) \\nbased on a domain theory. In PROLOG-EBG the explanation is constructed from a \\ndomain theory consisting of Horn clauses, and the target hypothesis is refined by \\ncalculating the weakest conditions under which this explanation holds. Relevant \\ndependencies in the explanation are thus captured in the learned Horn clause hy- \\npothesis. EBNN constructs an analogous explanation, but it is based on a domain \\ntheory consisting of neural networks rather than Horn clauses. As in PROLOG-EBG, \\nrelevant dependencies are then extracted from the explanation and used to refine \\nthe target hypothesis. In the case of EBNN, these dependencies take the form \\nof derivatives because derivatives are the natural way to represent dependencies \\nin continuous functions such as neural networks. In contrast, the natural way to \\nrepresent dependencies in symbolic explanations or logical proofs is to describe \\nthe set of examples to which the proof applies. \\nThere are several differences in capabilities between EBNN and the sym- \\nbolic explanation-based methods of Chapter 11. The main difference is that EBNN \\naccommodates imperfect domain theories, whereas PROLOG-EBG does not. This \\ndifference follows from the fact that EBNN is built on the inductive mechanism \\nof fitting the observed training values and uses the domain theory only as an addi- \\ntional constraint on the learned hypothesis. A second important difference follows \\nfrom the fact that PROLOG-EBG learns a growing set of Horn clauses, whereas \\nEBNN learns a fixed-size neural network. As discussed in Chapter 11, one diffi- \\nculty in learning sets of Horn clauses is that the cost of classifying a new instance \\ngrows as learning proceeds and new Horn clauses are added. This problem is \\navoided in EBNN because the fixed-size target network requires constant time to \\nclassify new instances. However, the fixed-size neural network suffers the cor- \\nresponding disadvantage that it may be unable to represent sufficiently complex \\nfunctions, whereas a growing set of Horn clauses can represent increasingly com- \\nplex functions.

In this section we consider a \\nthird way of using prior knowledge to alter the hypothesis space search: using \\nit to alter the set of operators that define legal steps in the search through the \\nhypothesis space. This approach is followed by systems such as FOCL (Pazzani \\net al. 1991; Pazzani and Kibler 1992) and ML-SMART (Bergadano and Giordana \\n1990). Here we use FOCL to illustrate the approach. \\n12.5.1 The FOCL Algorithm \\nFOCL is an extension of the purely inductive FOIL system described in Chap- \\nter 10. Both FOIL and FOCL learn a set of first-order Horn clauses to cover the \\nobserved training examples. Both systems employ a sequential covering algorithm \\nthat learns a single Horn clause, removes the positive examples covered by this \\nnew Horn clause, and then iterates this procedure over the remaining training \\nexamples. In both systems, each new Horn clause is created by performing a \\ngeneral-to-specific search, beginning with the most general possible Horn clause \\n(i.e., a clause containing no preconditions). Several candidate specializations of \\nthe current clause are then generated, and the specialization with greatest infor- \\nmation gain relative to the training examples is chosen. This process is iterated, \\ngenerating further candidate specializations and selecting the best, until a Horn \\nclause with satisfactory performance is obtained. \\nThe difference between FOIL and FOCL lies in the way in which candidate \\nspecializations are generated during the general-to-specific search for a single Horn \\nclause. As described in Chapter 10, FOIL generates each candidate specialization \\nby adding a single new literal to the clause preconditions. FOCL uses this same \\nmethod for producing candidate specializations, but also generates additional spe- \\ncializations based on the domain theory. The solid edges in the search tree of Fig- \\nure 12.8 show the general-to-specific search steps considered in a typical search by \\nFOIL. The dashed edge in the search tree of Figure 12.8 denotes an additional can- \\ndidate specialization that is considered by FOCL and based on the domain theory. \\nAlthough FOCL and FOIL both learn first-order Horn clauses, we illustrate \\ntheir operation here using the simpler domain of propositional (variable-free) Horn \\nclauses. In particular, consider again the Cup target concept, training examples, \\nand domain theory from Figure 12.3. To describe the operation of FOCL, we must \\nfirst draw a distinction between two kinds of literals that appear in the domain \\ntheory and hypothesis representation. We will say a literal is operational if it is \\nallowed to be used in describing an output hypothesis. For example, in the Cup \\nexample of Figure 12.3 we allow output hypotheses to refer only to the 12 at- \\ntributes that describe the training examples (e.g., HasHandle, HandleOnTop). \\nLiterals based on these 12 attributes are thus considered operational.

Create an operational, logically sufficient condition for the target concept \\naccording to the domain theory. Add this set of literals to the current precon- \\nditions of h. Finally, prune the preconditions of h by removing any literals \\nthat are unnecessary according to the training data.

FOCL \\nfirst selects one of the domain theory clauses whose head (postcondition) matches \\nthe target concept. If there are several such clauses, it selects the clause whose \\nbody (preconditions) have the highest information gain relative to the training \\nexamples of the target concept. For example, in the domain theory and training \\ndata of Figure 12.3, there is only one such clause: \\nCup t Stable, Lifable, Openvessel \\nThe preconditions of the selected clause form a logically sufficient condition for \\nthe target concept. Each nonoperational literal in these sufficient conditions is \\nnow replaced, again using the domain theory and substituting clause precondi- \\ntions for clause postconditions. For example, the domain theory clause Stable t \\nBottomIsFlat is used to substitute the operational BottomIsFlat for the unopera- \\ntional Stable. This process of \"unfolding\" the domain theory continues until the \\nsufficient conditions have been restated in terms of operational literals. If there \\nare several alternative domain theory clauses that produce different results, then \\nthe one with the greatest information gain is greedily selected at each step of \\nthe unfolding process.

For each literal in the expression, the literal is removed unless its removal \\nreduces classification accuracy over the training examples. This step is included \\nto recover from overspecialization in case the imperfect domain theory includes \\nirrelevant literals.

To summarize, FOCL learns Horn clauses of the form \\nwhere c is the target concept, oi is an initial conjunction of operational literals \\nadded one at a time by the first syntactic operator, ob is a conjunction of oper- \\national literals added in a single step based on the domain theory, and of is a \\nfinal conjunction of operational literals added one at a time by the first syntactic \\noperator.

Chapter 10 discusses in \\ndetail the algorithm used by FOIL to generate first-order Horn clauses, including \\nthe extension of the first of the two search operators described above to first-order \\nrepresentations. To extend the second operator to accommodate first-order domain \\ntheories, variable substitutions must be considered when unfolding the domain \\ntheory. This can be accomplished using a procedure related to the regression \\nprocedure described in Table 1 1.3. \\n12.5.2 Remarks \\nFOCL uses the domain theory to increase the number of candidate specializations \\nconsidered at each step of the search for a single Horn clause.

This network is then inductively refined using the BACKPROPAGATION \\nalgorithm, to improve its performance over the training data.

With this neural network representation, however, infor- \\nmation about relevance is expressed in the form of derivatives of the target \\nfunction value with respect to instance features. The network hypothesis is \\ntrained using a variant of the TANGENTPROP algorithm, in which the error to \\nbe minimized includes both the error in network output values and the error \\nin network derivatives obtained from explanations. \\nFOCL uses the domain theory to expand the set of candidates considered at \\neach step in the search.

This very generic problem covers tasks such as learning to control a mobile \\nrobot, learning to optimize operations in factories, and learning to play board games. \\nEach time the agent performs an action in its environment, a trainer may provide a \\nreward or penalty to indicate the desirability of the resulting state. For example, when \\ntraining an agent to play a game the trainer might provide a positive reward when the \\ngame is won, negative reward when it is lost, and zero reward in all other states. The \\ntask of the agent is to learn from this indirect, delayed reward, to choose sequences \\nof actions that produce the greatest cumulative reward. This chapter focuses on \\nan algorithm called Q learning that can acquire optimal control strategies from \\ndelayed rewards, even when the agent has no prior knowledge of the effects of \\nits actions on the environment. Reinforcement learning algorithms are related to \\ndynamic programming algorithms frequently used to solve optimization problems. \\n13.1 INTRODUCTION \\nConsider building a learning robot. The robot, or agent, has a set of sensors to \\nobserve the state of its environment, and a set of actions it can perform to alter \\nthis state. For example, a mobile robot may have sensors such as a camera and \\nsonars, and actions such as \"move forward\" and \"turn.\" Its task is to learn a control \\nstrategy, or policy, for choosing actions that achieve its goals.

We assume that the goals of the \\nagent can be defined by a reward function that assigns a numerical value-an \\nimmediate payoff-to each distinct action the agent may take from each distinct \\nstate. For example, the goal of docking to the battery charger can be captured by \\nassigning a positive reward (e.g., +loo) to state-action transitions that immediately \\nresult in a connection to the charger and a reward of zero to every other state-action \\ntransition. This reward function may be built into the robot, or known only to an \\nexternal teacher who provides the reward value for each action performed by the \\nrobot. The task of the robot is to perform sequences of actions, observe their conse- \\nquences, and learn a control policy. The control policy we desire is one that, from \\nany initial state, chooses actions that maximize the reward accumulated over time \\nby the agent. This general setting for robot learning is summarized in Figure 13.1. \\nAs is apparent from Figure 13.1, the problem of learning a control policy to \\nmaximize cumulative reward is very general and covers many problems beyond \\nrobot learning tasks. In general the problem is one of learning to control sequential \\nprocesses. This includes, for example, manufacturing optimization problems in \\nwhich a sequence of manufacturing actions must be chosen, and the reward to \\nbe maximized is the value of the goods produced minus the costs involved. It \\nincludes sequential scheduling problems such as choosing which taxis to send \\nfor passengers in a large city, where the reward to be maximized is a function \\nof the wait time of the passengers and the total fuel costs of the taxi fleet. In \\ngeneral, we are interested in any type of agent that must learn to choose actions \\nthat alter the state of its environment and where a cumulative reward function \\nis used to define the quality of any given action sequence.

In Section 11.4 we discussed explanation-based \\nlearning of rules to control search during problem solving. There the problem is \\nfor the agent to choose among alternative actions at each step in its search for some \\ngoal state. The techniques discussed here differ from those of Section 11.4, in that \\nhere we consider problems where the actions may have nondeterministic outcomes \\nand where the learner lacks a domain theory that describes the outcomes of its \\nactions. In Chapter 1 we discussed the problem of learning to choose actions while \\nplaying the game of checkers. There we sketched the design of a learning method \\nvery similar to those discussed in this chapter. In fact, one highly successful \\napplication of the reinforcement learning algorithms of this chapter is to a similar \\ngame-playing problem. Tesauro (1995) describes the TD-GAMMON program, which \\nhas used reinforcement learning to become a world-class backgammon player. This \\nprogram, after training on 1.5 million self-generated games, is now considered \\nnearly equal to the best human players in the world and has played competitively \\nagainst top-ranked players in international backgammon tournaments. \\nThe problem of learning a control policy to choose actions is similar in some \\nrespects to the function approximation problems discussed in other chapters. The \\ntarget function to be learned in this case is a control policy, n : S + A, that \\noutputs an appropriate action a from the set A, given the current state s from the \\nset S. However, this reinforcement learning problem differs from other function \\napproximation tasks in several important respects. \\n0 Delayed reward. The task of the agent is to learn a target function n that \\nmaps from the current state s to the optimal action a = n(s). In earlier \\nchapters we have always assumed that when learning some target function \\nsuch as n, each training example would be a pair of the form (s, n(s)). In \\nreinforcement learning, however, training information is not available in this \\nform. Instead, the trainer provides only a sequence of immediate reward val- \\nues as the agent executes its sequence of actions. The agent, therefore, faces \\nthe problem of temporal credit assignment: determining which of the actions \\nin its sequence are to be credited with producing the eventual rewards. \\n0 Exploration. In reinforcement learning, the agent influences the distribution \\nof training examples by the action sequence it chooses. This raises the ques- \\ntion of which experimentation strategy produces most effective learning. The \\nlearner faces a tradeoff in choosing whether to favor exploration of unknown \\nstates and actions (to gather new information), or exploitation of states and \\nactions that it has already learned will yield high reward (to maximize its \\ncumulative reward). \\n0 Partially observable states.

In such cases, it may be necessary for the agent to consider its \\nprevious observations together with its current sensor data when choosing \\nactions, and the best policy may be one that chooses actions specifically to \\nimprove the observability of the environment. \\nLife-long learning. Unlike isolated function approximation tasks, robot learn- \\ning often requires that the robot learn several related tasks within the same \\nenvironment, using the same sensors. For example, a mobile robot may need \\nto learn how to dock on its battery charger, how to navigate through nar- \\nrow corridors, and how to pick up output from laser printers. This setting \\nraises the possibility of using previously obtained experience or knowledge \\nto reduce sample complexity when learning new tasks. \\n13.2 THE LEARNING TASK \\nIn this section we formulate the problem of learning sequential control strategies \\nmore precisely. Note there are many ways to do so. For example, we might assume \\nthe agent's actions are deterministic or that they are nondeterministic. We might \\nassume that the agent can predict the next state that will result from each action, or \\nthat it cannot. We might assume that the agent is trained by an expert who shows \\nit examples of optimal action sequences, or that it must train itself by performing \\nactions of its own choice. Here we define one quite general formulation of the \\nproblem, based on Markov decision processes. This formulation of the problem \\nfollows the problem illustrated in Figure 13.1. \\nIn a Markov decision process (MDP) the agent can perceive a set S of distinct \\nstates of its environment and has a set A of actions that it can perform. At each \\ndiscrete time step t, the agent senses the current state st, chooses a current action \\na,, and performs it. The environment responds by giving the agent a reward r, = \\nr (st, a,) and by producing the succeeding state s,+l = 6(s,, a,). Here the functions \\n6 and r are part of the environment and are not necessarily known to the agent. \\nIn an MDP, the functions 6(st, a,) and r(s,, a,) depend only on the current state \\nand action, and not on earlier states or actions. In this chapter we consider only \\nthe case in which S and A are finite. In general, 6 and r may be nondeterministic \\nfunctions, but we begin by considering only the deterministic case. \\nThe task of the agent is to learn a policy, n : S + A, for selecting its next \\naction a, based on the current observed state st; that is, n(s,) = a,. How shall we \\nspecify precisely which policy n we would like the agent to learn? One obvious \\napproach is to require the policy that produces the greatest possible cumulative \\nreward for the robot over time. To state this requirement more precisely, we define \\nthe cumulative value Vn(s,) achieved by following an arbitrary policy n from an \\narbitrary initial state st as follows:\"), Document(metadata={'producer': 'macOS Version 11.2.3 (Build 20D91) Quartz PDFContext', 'creator': 'Preview', 'creationdate': \"D:20210312135113Z00'00'\", 'title': 'Machine - Learning - Tom Mitchell.pdf', 'moddate': \"D:20210312135113Z00'00'\", 'source': '..\\\\Data\\\\PDFiles\\\\MachineLearningTomMitchell.pdf', 'total_pages': 421, 'page': 382, 'page_label': '383'}, page_content='CHAPTER 13 REINFORCEMENT LEARNING 371 \\nwhere the sequence of rewards rt+i is generated by beginning at state s, and by \\nrepeatedly using the policy n to select actions as described above (i.e., a, = n(st), \\na,+l = n(~,+~), etc.). Here 0 5 y < 1 is a constant that determines the relative \\nvalue of delayed versus immediate rewards. In particular, rewards received i time \\nsteps into the future are discounted exponentially by a factor of y \\'. Note if we set \\ny = 0, only the immediate reward is considered. As we set y closer to 1, future \\nrewards are given greater emphasis relative to the immediate reward. \\nThe quantity VX(s) defined by Equation (13.1) is often called the discounted \\ncumulative reward achieved by policy n from initial state s. It is reasonable to \\ndiscount future rewards relative to immediate rewards because, in many cases, \\nwe prefer to obtain the reward sooner rather than later. However, other defini- \\ntions of total reward have also been explored. For example, jinite horizon reward, \\nc:=, rt+i, considers the undiscounted sum of rewards over a finite number h of . - \\nsteps. Another possibility is average reward, limb,, cF=~ rt+i, which consid- \\ners the average reward per time step over the entire lifetime of the agent. In \\nthis chapter we restrict ourselves to considering discounted reward as defined \\nby Equation (13.1). Mahadevan (1996) provides a discussion of reinforcement \\nlearning when the criterion to be optimized is average reward. \\nWe are now in a position to state precisely the agent\\'s learning task. We \\nrequire that the agent learn a policy n that maximizes V\"(s) for all states s. \\nWe will call such a policy an optimal policy and denote it by T*. \\nn* r argmax V\" (s), (Vs) \\nX \\nTo simplify notation, we will refer to the value function v\"*(s) of such an optimal \\npolicy as V*(s). V*(s) gives the maximum discounted cumulative reward that the \\nagent can obtain starting from state s; that is, the discounted cumulative reward \\nobtained by following the optimal policy beginning at state s. \\nTo illustrate these concepts, a simple grid-world environment is depicted \\nin the topmost diagram of Figure 13.2. The six grid squares in this diagram \\nrepresent six possible states, or locations, for the agent. Each arrow in the diagram \\nrepresents a possible action the agent can take to move from one state to another. \\nThe number associated with each arrow represents the immediate reward r(s, a) \\nthe agent receives if it executes the corresponding state-action transition. Note \\nthe immediate reward in this particular environment is defined to be zero for \\nall state-action transitions except for those leading into the state labeled G. It is \\nconvenient to think of the state G as the goal state, because the only way the agent \\ncan receive reward, in this case, is by entering this state. Note in this particular \\nenvironment, the only action available to the agent once it enters the state G is \\nto remain in this state. For this reason, we call G an absorbing state. \\nOnce the states, actions, and immediate rewards are defined, and once we \\nchoose a value for the discount factor y, we can determine the optimal policy n* \\nand its value function V*(s). In this case, let us choose y = 0.9. The diagram \\nat the bottom of the figure shows one optimal policy for this setting (there are \\nothers as well).

It is \\ndifficult to learn the function rt* : S + A directly, because the available training \\ndata does not provide training examples of the form (s, a). Instead, the only \\ntraining information available to the learner is the sequence of immediate rewards \\nr(si, ai) for i = 0, 1,2, . . . . As we shall see, given this kind of training information \\nit is easier to learn a numerical evaluation function defined over states and actions, \\nthen implement the optimal policy in terms of this evaluation function. \\nWhat evaluation function should the agent attempt to learn? One obvious \\nchoice is V*. The agent should prefer state sl over state s2 whenever V*(sl) > \\nV*(s2), because the cumulative future reward will be greater from sl. Of course \\nthe agent's policy must choose among actions, not among states. However, it can \\nuse V* in certain settings to choose among actions as well. The optimal action \\nin state s is the action a that maximizes the sum of the immediate reward r(s, a) \\nplus the value V* of the immediate successor state, discounted by y. \\nn*(s) = argmax[r(s, a) f y V*(G(s, a))] \\na \\n(recall that 6(s, a) denotes the state resulting from applying action a to state s.) \\nThus, the agent can acquire the optimal policy by learning V*, provided it has \\nperfect knowledge of the immediate reward function r and the state transition \\nfunction 6. When the agent knows the functions r and 6 used by the environment \\nto respond to its actions, it can then use Equation (13.3) to calculate the optimal \\naction for any state s. \\nUnfortunately, learning V* is a useful way to learn the optimal policy only \\nwhen the agent has perfect knowledge of 6 and r. This requires that it be able to \\nperfectly predict the immediate result (i.e., the immediate reward and immediate \\nsuccessor) for every possible state-action transition. This assumption is compara- \\nble to the assumption of a perfect domain theory in explanation-based learning, \\ndiscussed in Chapter 11. In many practical problems, such as robot control, it \\nis impossible for the agent or its human programmer to predict in advance the \\nexact outcome of applying an arbitrary action to an arbitrary state. Imagine, for \\nexample, the difficulty in describing 6 for a robot arm shoveling dirt when the \\nresulting state includes the positions of the dirt particles.

As Equation (13.5) makes clear, \\nit need only consider each available action a in its current state s and choose the \\naction that maximizes Q(s, a). \\nIt may at first seem surprising that one can choose globally optimal action \\nsequences by reacting repeatedly to the local values of Q for the current state. \\nThis means the agent can choose the optimal action without ever conducting a \\nlookahead search to explicitly consider what state results from the action. Part of \\nthe beauty of Q learning is that the evaluation function is defined to have precisely \\nthis property-the value of Q for the current state and action summarizes in a \\nsingle number all the information needed to determine the discounted cumulative \\nreward that will be gained in the future if action a is selected in state s. \\nTo illustrate, Figure 13.2 shows the Q values for every state and action in the \\nsimple grid world.

Third, we assume the agent selects actions in such \\na fashion that it visits every possible state-action pair infinitely often. By this \\nthird condition we mean that if action a is a legal action from state s, then over \\ntime the agent must execute action a from state s repeatedly and with nonzero \\nfrequency as the length of its action sequence approaches infinity.

However, the result described in this section provides \\nthe basic intuition for understanding why Q learning works. \\nThe key idea underlying the proof of convergence is that the table entry \\n~(s, a) with the largest error must have its error reduced by a factor of y whenever \\nit is updated. The reason is that its new value depends only in part on error-prone \\nQ estimates, with the remainder depending on the error-free observed immediate \\nreward r. \\nTheorem 13.1. Convergence of Q learning for deterministic Markov decision \\nprocesses. Consider a Q learning agent in a deterministic MDP with bounded re- \\nwards (Vs, a) lr(s, a)[ 5 c. The* Q learning agent uses the training rule of Equa- \\ntion (13.7), initializes its table Q(s, a) to arbitrary finite values, and uses a discount \\nfactor y such that 0 y < 1. Let Q,(s, a) denote the agent\\'s hypothesis ~(s, a) \\nfollowing the nth update. If each state-action pair is visited infinitely often, then \\nQ,(s, a) converges to Q(s, a) as n + oo, for all s, a. \\nProof. Since each state-action transition occurs infinitely often, consider consecutive \\nintervals during which each state-action transition occurs at least once. The proof \\nconsists of showing that the maximum error over all entries in the Q table is reduced \\nby at least a factor of y during each such interval.

One obvious strategy would be for the agent in state s to select the action a \\nthat maximizes ~(s, a), thereby exploiting its current approximation Q. However, \\nwith this strategy the agent runs the risk that it will overcommit to actions that \\nare found during early training to have high Q values, while failing to explore \\nother actions that have even higher values. In fact, the convergence theorem above \\nrequires that each state-action transition occur infinitely often. This will clearly \\nnot occur if the agent always selects actions that maximize its current &(s, a). For \\nthis reason, it is common in Q learning to use a probabilistic approach to selecting \\nactions. Actions with higher Q values are assigned higher probabilities, but every \\naction is assigned a nonzero probability. One way to assign such probabilities is \\nwhere P(ai 1s) is the probability of selecting action ai, given that the agent is in \\nstate s, and where k > 0 is a constant that determines how strongly the selection \\nfavors actions with high Q values. Larger values of k will assign higher proba- \\nbilities to actions with above average Q, causing the agent to exploit what it has \\nlearned and seek actions it believes will maximize its reward. In contrast, small \\nvalues of k will allow higher probabilities for other actions, leading the agent \\nto explore actions that do not currently have high Q values. In some cases, k is \\nvaried with the number of iterations so that the agent favors exploration during \\nearly stages of learning, then gradually shifts toward a strategy of exploitation. \\n13.3.6 Updating Sequence \\nOne important implication of the above convergence theorem is that Q learning \\nneed not train on optimal action sequences in order to converge to the optimal \\npolicy. In fact, it can learn the Q function (and hence the optimal policy) while \\ntraining from actions chosen completely at random at each step, as long as the \\nresulting training sequence visits every state-action transition infinitely often. This \\nfact suggests changing the sequence of training example transitions in order to \\nimprove training efficiency without endangering final convergence. To illustrate, \\nconsider again learning in an MDP with a single absorbing goal state, such as the \\none in Figure 13.1. Assume as before that we train the agent with a sequence of \\nepisodes. For each episode, the agent is placed in a random initial state and is \\nallowed to perform actions and to update its Q table until it reaches the absorbing \\ngoal state. A new training episode is then begun by removing the agent from the'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'macOS Version 11.2.3 (Build 20D91) Quartz PDFContext', 'creator': 'Preview', 'creationdate': \"D:20210312135113Z00'00'\", 'title': 'Machine - Learning - Tom Mitchell.pdf', 'moddate': \"D:20210312135113Z00'00'\", 'source': '..\\\\Data\\\\PDFiles\\\\MachineLearningTomMitchell.pdf', 'total_pages': 421, 'page': 391, 'page_label': '392'}, page_content=\"goal state and placing it at a new random initial state. As noted earlier, if we \\nbegin with all Q values initialized to zero, then after the first full episode only \\none entry in the agent's Q table will have been changed: the entry corresponding \\nto the final transition into the goal state. Note that if the agent happens to follow \\nthe same sequence of actions from the same random initial state in its second full \\nepisode, then a second table entry would be made nonzero, and so on. If we run \\nrepeated identical episodes in this fashion, the frontier of nonzero Q values will \\ncreep backward from the goal state at the rate of one new state-action transition \\nper episode. Now consider training on these same state-action transitions, but in \\nreverse chronological order for each episode. That is, we apply the same update \\nrule from Equation (13.7) for each transition considered, but perform these updates \\nin reverse order. In this case, after the first full episode the agent will have updated \\nits Q estimate for every transition along the path it took to the goal. This training \\nprocess will clearly converge in fewer iterations, although it requires that the agent \\nuse more memory to store the entire episode before beginning the training for that \\nepisode. \\nA second strategy for improving the rate of convergence is to store past \\nstate-action transitions, along with the immediate reward that was received, and \\nretrain on them periodically. Although at first it might seem a waste of effort to \\nretrain on the same transition, recall that the updated ~(s, a) value is determined \\nby the values ~(s', a) of the successor state s' = 6(s, a). Therefore, if subsequent \\ntraining changes one of the ~(s', a) values, then retraining on the transition (s, a) \\nmay result in an altered value for ~(s, a). In general, the degree to which we wish \\nto replay old transitions versus obtain new ones from the environment depends \\non the relative costs of these two operations in the specific problem domain. For \\nexample, in a robot domain with navigation actions that might take several seconds \\nto perform, the delay in collecting a new state-action transition from the external \\nworld might be several orders of magnitude more costly than internally replaying \\na previously observed transition. This difference can be very significant given that \\nQ learning can often require thousands of training iterations to converge. \\nNote throughout the above discussion we have kept our assumption that the \\nagent does not know the state-transition function 6(s, a) used by the environment \\nto create the successor state s' = S(s, a), or the function r(s, a) used to generate \\nrewards. If it does know these two functions, then many more efficient methods \\nare possible. For example, if performing external actions is expensive the agent \\nmay simply ignore the environment and instead simulate it internally, efficiently \\ngenerating simulated actions and assigning the appropriate simulated rewards. \\nSutton (1991) describes the DYNA architecture that performs a number of simulated \\nactions after each step executed in the external world.

Here we consider \\nthe nondeterministic case, in which the reward function r(s, a) and action transi- \\ntion function 6(s, a) may have probabilistic outcomes. For example, in Tesaur~\\'~ \\n(1995) backgammon playing program, action outcomes are inherently probabilis- \\ntic because each move involves a roll of the dice. Similarly, in robot problems \\nwith noisy sensors and effectors it is often appropriate to model actions and re- \\nwards as nondeterministic. In such cases, the functions 6(s, a) and r(s, a) can be \\nviewed as first producing a probability distribution over outcomes based on s and \\na, and then drawing an outcome at random according to this distribution. When \\nthese probability distributions depend solely on s and a (e.g., they do not depend \\non previous states or actions), then we call the system a nondeterministic Markov \\ndecision process. \\nIn this section we extend the Q learning algorithm for the deterministic \\ncase to handle nondeterministic MDPs. To accomplish this, we retrace the line \\nof argument that led to the algorithm for the deterministic case, revising it where \\nneeded. \\nIn the nondeterministic case we must first restate the objective of the learner \\nto take into account the fact that outcomes of actions are no longer deterministic. \\nThe obvious generalization is to redefine the value V\" of a policy n to be the ex- \\npected value (over these nondeterministic outcomes) of the discounted cumulative \\nreward received by applying this policy \\nwhere, as before, the sequence of rewards r,+i is generated by following policy \\nn beginning at state s.

Whereas the \\ntraining rule of Equation (13.10) reduces the difference between the estimated Q \\nvalues of a state and its immediate successor, we could just as well design an algo- \\nrithm that reduces discrepancies between this state and more distant descendants \\nor ancestors. \\nTo explore this issue further, recall that our Q learning training rule calcu- \\nlates a training value for &(st, a,) in terms of the values for &(s,+l, at+l) where \\ns,+l is the result of applying action a, to the state st. Let Q(')(s,, a,) denote the \\ntraining value calculated by this one-step lookahead \\nOne alternative way to compute a training value for Q(s,, a,) is to base it on the \\nobserved rewards for two steps \\n2 \\n st, a,) = rt + yr,+l + y max Q(s~+~, a) \\nor, in general, for n steps \\nQ(~)(s,,~,) = rt + yr,+l + ,-. + y(n-l)rt+n-l + ynmax&(s,+,,a) \\nSutton (1988) introduces a general method for blending these alternative \\ntraining estimates, called TD(h). The idea is to use a constant 0 5 h 5 1 to \\ncombine the estimates obtained from various lookahead distances in the following \\nfashion \\nAn equivalent recursive definition for Qh is \\nNote if we choose h = 0 we have our original training estimate Q('), which \\nconsiders only one-step discrepancies in the Q estimates. As h is increased, the al- \\ngorithm places increasing emphasis on discrepancies based on more distant looka- \\nheads.

Note when Q = Q, the training \\nvalues given by Qh will be identical for all values of h such that 0 5 h 5 I. \\nThe motivation for the TD(h) method is that in some settings training will \\nbe more efficient if more distant lookaheads are considered. For example, when \\nthe agent follows an optimal policy for choosing actions, then eh with h = 1 will \\nprovide a perfect estimate for the true Q value, regardless of any inaccuracies in \\nQ. On the other hand, if action sequences are chosen suboptimally, then the r,+i \\nobserved far into the future can be misleading. \\nPeng and Williams (1994) provide a further discussion and experimental \\nresults showing the superior performance of Qqn one problem domain. Dayan \\n(1992) shows that under certain assumptions a similar TD(h) approach applied \\nto learning the V* function converges correctly for any h such that 0 5 A 5 1. \\nTesauro (1995) uses a TD(h) approach in his TD-GAMMON program for playing \\nbackgammon. \\n13.6 GENERALIZING FROM EXAMPLES \\nPerhaps the most constraining assumption in our treatment of Q learning up to \\nthis point is that the target function is represented as an explicit lookup table, \\nwith a distinct table entry for every distinct input value (i.e., state-action pair). \\nThus, the algorithms we discussed perform a kind of rote learning and make \\nno attempt to estimate the Q value for unseen state-action pairs by generalizing \\nfrom those that have been seen. This rote learning assumption is reflected in the \\nconvergence proof, which proves convergence only if every possible state-action \\npair is visited (infinitely often!). This is clearly an unrealistic assumption in large \\nor infinite spaces, or when the cost of executing actions is high. As a result, \\nmore practical systems often combine function approximation methods discussed \\nin other chapters with the Q learning training rules described here. \\nIt is easy to incorporate function approximation algorithms such as BACK- \\nPROPAGATION into the Q learning algorithm, by substituting a neural network for \\nthe lookup table and using each ~(s, a) update as a training example. For example, \\nwe could encode the state s and action a as network inputs and train the network \\nto output the target values of Q given by the training rules of Equations (13.7) \\nand (13.10). An alternative that has sometimes been found to be more successful \\nin practice is to train a separate network for each action, using the state as input \\nand Q as output. Another common alternative -is to train one network with the \\nstate as input, but with one Q output for each action. Recall that in Chapter 1, we \\ndiscussed approximating an evaluation function over checkerboard states using a \\nlinear function and the LMS algorithm. \\nIn practice, a number of successful reinforcement learning systems have been \\ndeveloped by incorporating such function approximation algorithms in place of the \\nlookup table. Tesauro's successful TD-GAMMON program for playing backgammon \\nused a neural network and the BACKPROPAGATION algorithm together with a TD(A) \\ntraining rule. Zhang and Dietterich (1996) use a similar combination of BACKPROP- \\nAGATION and TD(h) for job-shop scheduling tasks.

This earlier work has typically assumed that the agent possesses perfect \\nknowledge of the functions S(s, a) and r(s, a) that define the agent's environment. \\nTherefore, it has primarily addressed the question of how to compute the optimal \\npolicy using the least computational effort, assuming the environment could be \\nperfectly simulated and no direct interaction was required. The novel aspect of \\nQ learning is that it assumes the agent does not have knowledge of S(s, a) and \\nr(s, a), and that instead of moving about in an internal mental model of the state \\nspace, it must move about the real world and observe the consequences. In this \\nlatter case our primary concern is usually the number of real-world actions that the \\nagent must perform to converge to an acceptable policy, rather than the number of \\ncomputational cycles it must expend. The reason is that in many practical domains \\nsuch as manufacturing problems, the costs in time and in dollars of performing \\nactions in the external world dominate the computational costs. Systems that learn \\nby moving about the real environment and observing the results are typically called \\nonline systems, whereas those that learn solely by simulating actions within an \\ninternal model are called ofline systems. \\nThe close correspondence between these earlier approaches and the rein- \\nforcement learning problems discussed here is apparent by considering Bellman's \\nequation, which forms the foundation for many dynamic programming approaches\"), Document(metadata={'producer': 'macOS Version 11.2.3 (Build 20D91) Quartz PDFContext', 'creator': 'Preview', 'creationdate': \"D:20210312135113Z00'00'\", 'title': 'Machine - Learning - Tom Mitchell.pdf', 'moddate': \"D:20210312135113Z00'00'\", 'source': '..\\\\Data\\\\PDFiles\\\\MachineLearningTomMitchell.pdf', 'total_pages': 421, 'page': 397, 'page_label': '398'}, page_content=\"to solving MDPs.

Bellman (1957) showed that the \\noptimal policy n* satisfies the above equation and that any policy n satisfying \\nthis equation is an optimal policy. Early work on dynamic programming includes \\nthe Bellman-Ford shortest path algorithm (Bellman 1958; Ford and Fulkerson \\n1962), which learns paths through a graph by repeatedly updating the estimated \\ndistance to the goal for each graph node, based on the distances for its neigh- \\nbors. In this algorithm the assumption that graph edges and the goal node are \\nknown is equivalent to our assumption that 6(s, a) and r(s, a) are known. Barto \\net al. (1995) discuss the close relationship between reinforcement learning and \\ndynamic programming. \\n13.8 SUMMARY AND FURTHER READING \\nThe key points discussed in this chapter include: \\n0 Reinforcement learning addresses the problem of learning control strategies \\nfor autonomous agents. It assumes that training information is available in \\nthe form of a real-valued reward signal given for each state-action transition. \\nThe goal of the agent is to learn an action policy that maximizes the total \\nreward it will receive from any starting state. \\n0 The reinforcement learning algorithms addressed in this chapter fit a problem \\nsetting known as a Markov decision process. In Markov decision processes, \\nthe outcome of applying any action to any state depends only on this ac- \\ntion and state (and not on preceding actions:or states). Markov decision \\nprocesses cover a wide range of problems including many robot control, \\nfactory automation, and scheduling problems. \\n0 Q learning is one form of reinforcement learning in which the agent learns \\nan evaluation function over states and actions. In particular, the evaluation \\nfunction Q(s, a) is defined as the maximum expected, discounted, cumulative \\nreward the agent can achieve by applying action a to state s. The Q learning \\nalgorithm has the advantage that it can-be employed even when the learner \\nhas no prior knowledge of how its actions affect its environment. \\n0 Q learning can be proven to converge to the correct Q function under cer- \\ntain assumptions, when the learner's hypothesis ~(s, a) is represented by a \\nlookup table with a distinct entry for each (s, a) pair. It can be shown to \\nconverge in both deterministic and nondeterministic MDPs. In practice, Q \\nlearning can require many thousands of training iterations to converge in \\neven modest-sized problems. \\n0 Q learning is a member of a more general class of algorithms, called tem- \\nporal difference algorithms. In general, temporal difference algorithms learn\"), Document(metadata={'producer': 'macOS Version 11.2.3 (Build 20D91) Quartz PDFContext', 'creator': 'Preview', 'creationdate': \"D:20210312135113Z00'00'\", 'title': 'Machine - Learning - Tom Mitchell.pdf', 'moddate': \"D:20210312135113Z00'00'\", 'source': '..\\\\Data\\\\PDFiles\\\\MachineLearningTomMitchell.pdf', 'total_pages': 421, 'page': 398, 'page_label': '399'}, page_content=\"CHAFER 13 REINFORCEMENT LEARNING 387 \\nby iteratively reducing the discrepancies between the estimates produced by \\nthe agent at different times. \\nReinforcement learning is closely related to dynamic programming ap- \\nproaches to Markov decision processes. The key difference is that histori- \\ncally these dynamic programming approaches have assumed that the agent \\npossesses knowledge of the state transition function 6(s, a) and reward func- \\ntion r (s , a). In contrast, reinforcement learning algorithms such as Q learning \\ntypically assume the learner lacks such knowledge. \\nThe common theme that underlies much of the work on reinforcement learn- \\ning is to iteratively reduce the discrepancy between evaluations of successive \\nstates. Some of the earliest work on such methods is due to Samuel (1959). His \\ncheckers learning program attempted to learn an evaluation function for checkers \\nby using evaluations of later states to generate training values for earlier states. \\nAround the same time, the Bellman-Ford, single-destination, shortest-path algo- \\nrithm was developed (Bellman 1958; Ford and Fulkerson 1962), which propagated \\ndistance-to-goal values from nodes to their neighbors. Research on optimal control \\nled to the solution of Markov decision processes using similar methods (Bellman \\n1961; Blackwell 1965). Holland's (1986) bucket brigade method for learning clas- \\nsifier systems used a similar method for propagating credit in the face of delayed \\nrewards. Barto et al. (1983) discussed an approach to temporal credit assignment \\nthat led to Sutton's paper (1988) defining the TD(k) method and proving its con- \\nvergence for k = 0. Dayan (1992) extended this result to arbitrary values of k. \\nWatkins (1989) introduced Q learning to acquire optimal policies when the re- \\nward and action transition functions are unknown. Convergence proofs are known \\nfor several variations on these methods. In addition to the convergence proofs \\npresented in this chapter see, for example, (Baird 1995; Bertsekas 1987; Tsitsiklis \\n1994, Singh and Sutton 1996). \\nReinforcement learning remains an active research area. McCallum (1995) \\nand Littman (1996), for example, discuss the extension of reinforcement learning \\nto settings with hidden state variables that violate the Markov assumption. Much \\ncurrent research seeks to scale up these methods to larger, more practical prob- \\nlems. For example, Maclin and Shavlik (1996) describe an approach in which a \\nreinforcement learning agent can accept imperfect advice from a trainer, based on \\nan extension to the KBANN algorithm (Chapter 12). Lin (1992) examines the role \\nof teaching by providing suggested action sequences. Methods for scaling Up by \\nemploying a hierarchy of actions are suggested by Singh (1993) and Lin (1993). \\nDietterich and Flann (1995) explore the integration of explanation-based methods \\nwith reinforcement learning, and Mitchell and Thrun (1993) describe the appli- \\ncation of the EBNN algorithm (Chapter 12) to Q learning. Ring (1994) explores \\ncontinual learning by the agent over multiple tasks. \\nRecent surveys of reinforcement learning are given by Kaelbling et al. \\n(1996); Barto (1992); Barto et al.

Instances are described by \\na fixed set of attributes (e.g., Temperature) and their values (e.g., Hot). The \\neasiest situation for decision tree learning is when each attribute takes on a \\nsmall number of disjoint possible values (e.g., Hot, Mild, Cold). However, \\nextensions to the basic algorithm (discussed in Section 3.7.2) allow handling \\nreal-valued attributes as well (e.g., representing Temperature numerically). \\nThe targetfunction has d',\n",

In rough analogy, artificial neural networks are built out \\nof a densely interconnected set of simple units, where each unit takes a number \\nof real-valued inputs (possibly the outputs of other units) and produces a single \\nreal-valued output (which may become the input to many other units). \\nTo develop a feel for this analogy, let us consider a few facts from neuro- \\nbiology. The human brain, for example, is estimated to contain a densely inter- \\nconnected network of approximately 1011 neurons, each connected, on average, to \\nlo4 others.
